# gate_link_kernel.sh — THE KERNEL SEAM: is link.la a drop-in for
# `ld -n -T kernel/kernel.ld` in track D's real kernel build?
#
#     boot.o --+--> ld -n -T kernel.ld --> objcopy -> QEMU   (control)
#              +--> link.la --script     --> objcopy -> QEMU   (ours)
#
# ONE VARIABLE MOVES: the SAME object goes into both linkers, so anything this
# finds is the linker's. That is the same discipline gate_link_e2e step 4b uses,
# and it is why this gate can name its own culprit.
#
# ── WHY THIS GATE EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# On 07-23 link.la linked the real kernel object byte-identically to ld and that
# looked like complete success by every check we had. The build's VERY NEXT LINE
# — `objcopy -O elf32-i386` — refused the image ("has no sections"). Item 12
# fixed that. But the claim still stopped at "the container is acceptable", one
# step short of the only thing anybody actually wants to know: DOES IT BOOT.
# This gate carries the chain to that step. Reproduce the real consumer's next
# step, not your own criterion.
#
# ── COST, AND WHY THIS IS NOT IN build.sh ───────────────────────────────────
# The link takes ~36 MINUTES for a 39 KB object (32 KB of it the incbin'd
# .la_image) — the known DROP curve, not a wrong algorithm. This is an ON-DEMAND
# gate, like track A's gate_bootelf.sh. Do not wire it into build.sh.
#
# ── WHAT IT DEPENDS ON, AND WHY IT SKIPS RATHER THAN FAILS ──────────────────
# kernel/boot.o and kernel/kernel.ld are TRACK D's. This reads them and writes
# NOTHING into kernel/. If they are absent it SKIPs: B does not own that half.
# ★ HONEST LIMIT, stated because it is a real weakness: boot.o is an UNCOMMITTED
# build artifact in D's worktree, so this gate tests whatever kernel D last
# built. It records the sha256 it actually tested so a green can be traced to a
# specific object. A fully reproducible version would assemble boot.asm here,
# which needs A's compiler for the incbin payload — a much longer chain.
