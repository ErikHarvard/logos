# ── STAGE 5: CROSS-ENGINE AUDIT ────────────────────────────────────────────
#  The scope's failure mode 4: "the audit runs on the engine that built it. A
#  synthesis artefact and its auditor sharing an evaluator share its bugs."
#  Synthesis happens on the C HOST (tiny_host runs selfext4.la), so the audit
#  must run somewhere else. This repo has five engines; the native SECD VM did
#  not perform the synthesis, so it is the independent witness.
#
#  ★ THE POINT IS NOT THAT TWO ENGINES AGREE. It is that DISAGREEMENT IS A
#  FAILURE rather than a note. Arm B proves the comparison can detect
#  disagreement at all, by deliberately giving the two engines DIFFERENT
#  modules and requiring the gate to refuse. Without arm B, "host == VM" is
#  satisfied by a comparison that always says yes.
#
#  ★★ AND ARM C PROVES THE SECOND ENGINE ACTUALLY RAN. A cross-engine gate that
#  silently fell back to the host when the VM was missing would report agreement
#  between an engine and itself -- absence of a witness presented as a witness,
#  which is the failure this project keeps finding. So the VM is removed and the
#  leg is required to FAIL rather than degrade.

# ── ★★ THE VM MUST EXIST, AND THIS GATE MUST NOT DEPEND ON WHO RAN BEFORE IT ──
#  run_vm executes ./logos_secd, but nothing here ever built it: the gate
#  silently inherited a VM left behind by some earlier build.sh section. The
#  section that last touches it before this one (theourgia text) DELETES it, so
#  the VM leg died with "No such file or directory" -- and ARM C's mv/mv-back
#  quietly did nothing. That went unnoticed because no build had ever reached
#  this far: the runs before it aborted at an earlier gate.
#  ★ A gate whose oracle is a LEFTOVER ARTIFACT is not a gate. It is also exactly
#  the failure arm C exists to catch, arriving through the door arm C does not
#  watch -- C proves the VM leg fails when the VM is REMOVED, and said nothing
#  about the VM never having been BUILT. So build our own, and refuse loudly if
#  we cannot, rather than reporting a missing engine as a wrong answer.
