# ★ WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT RUNS FIRST. Build 9 (2026-09-05) spent 57 MINUTES
# to discover that `incdata.bin` — an 8-byte fixture named ONLY in
# asm_test_sect.asm's `incbin`, never anywhere in build.sh, and swallowed by the
# blanket `*.bin` in .gitignore — is absent from a fresh clone, so the committed
# state does not build. That was the FOURTH clean-checkout break of this class.
# The clean-checkout probe finds these by RUNNING; this finds them by READING, in
# under a second, before anything else is compiled.
# ★ THE ORACLE IS `git ls-files`, NOT `git status`, and that is the whole point. A
# git-status sweep is STRUCTURALLY BLIND here: an ignored file never appears in
# git status at all, which is why an earlier sweep of this same class correctly
# "returned zero" while the build still failed. Both were right; they searched
# different idioms. ls-files sees ignored-but-tracked and reports untracked.
# ★ RED PATH, evaluated against b8e3ace — the exact commit build 9 failed on:
#   this check flags `incdata.bin`. It would have caught the real break.
# ★ HONEST SCOPE: `incbin` targets in tracked .asm only. `read_file(` targets in
#   .la are NOT swept — they are dominated by build products and runtime state
#   (logos_program.bin, organ.la, .sx*mode, /tmp/...), so gating them would need
#   an allowlist large enough to silently disable the check. Narrow and real
#   beats broad and switched-off.

# ── ARM 2: read_file targets. ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# ★ THIS ARM EXISTS BECAUSE THE SCOPE NOTE ABOVE WAS WRONG, AND MEASURING SAID SO.
# Arm 1 was shipped with a stated limit: read_file targets are "dominated by build
# products and runtime state, so gating them would need an allowlist large enough
# to silently disable the check". That was a reasonable prediction and it was
# checked rather than inherited. All 30 literal read_file targets in tracked .la
# classify BY RULE, with an allowlist of ZERO:
#     13  absolute (/tmp, /dev)          — not repo files
#      4  tracked                        — fine
#     10  produced by build.sh or the LA layer
#      3  runtime state written by tracked gate scripts (.sx2mode -> gate_selfext2.sh,
#        .sx4mode -> gate_selfext4.sh, .sx6budget -> gate_selfext6.sh)
#      0  needing human judgement
# What the prediction missed is that "written by a tracked .sh" is a RULE, not a
# list — one clause, and the whole runtime-state category classifies itself.
# ★ WHY IT IS WORTH HAVING SEPARATELY FROM ARM 1: str_at_fixture.bin is the same
# defect class as incdata.bin in a DIFFERENT IDIOM — reached by read_file, not
# incbin — so arm 1 is structurally blind to it. A sweep searches an idiom, not a
# class, and that is why the red path below unTRACKS str_at_fixture.bin rather
# than re-testing incdata.bin: a control that shares the subject's idiom proves

# because arms 1-2 could not see a shell invocation — true — and it worked. But
# it still missed asm_test_xsize.asm, a REAL past break (untracked 15 days,
# referenced as `cp asm_test_xsize.asm asm_in.asm` and `nasm -f bin ... X`):
# a data file passed as a command ARGUMENT is neither incbin'd, nor read_file'd,
# nor executed. Tested against a clean checkout of 3164274 with incdata.bin
# force-tracked to isolate it, the three-arm gate returned PASS, exit 0.
# ★ IT WENT RED ON THAT TREE FOR THE WRONG DEFECT, which is why the isolation
# mattered: a gate that fails for a reason other than the one you are testing
# looks exactly like coverage.

# ZERO are outside the 378 named ones. Keeping both would have been two checks
# over one class, free to drift apart — the thing this file already had to
# reconcile once today. So the narrow arm was REMOVED, not stacked. Its better

# cannot RUN this" is more actionable than "a clone lacks this".

#   ★ WHY IT WAS MISSING: sigil.la keyed the Archē on the NAME "LOGOS" while canon,
#   phonym and archroot keyed it on "∃". Two names, one referent — the exact polysemy
#   the language forbids, sitting inside the IMPLEMENTATION of a rule rather than in
#   the vocabulary. `PRIM("∃")` was UNDEF here, so R-A was not merely unenforced in
#   the visual register, it was INEXPRESSIBLE. "gated in BOTH registers" was true and
#   there were THREE.
#   ★ IT WAS A REAL DIVERGENCE, NOT A TIDY-UP: measured with the rule removed,
#   SIGIL(⊗(∃,∃)) and SIGIL(∃) render DIFFERENTLY while κ and the phonology both call
#   them one concept — two sigils for one concept, polysemy through the visual door.
#   The rule is therefore load-bearing, which was checked rather than assumed (the
#   ↻↻ case agrees across registers only because MC_SIG is accidentally idempotent on
#   H-symmetric forms — agreement by renderer coincidence, which proves nothing).
#   ★ The rename is OUTPUT-NEUTRAL: sigil.la's own 680-line render is byte-identical

    #       build. Found by applying the cross-track review checklist to my own
    #       work: "is the red path gated?" is worth nothing if the gate is not
    #       in the build at all.
    #       asm_test_movlbl joins them for the same reason, one commit later:
    #       4d39c74 landed it RED and unwired on purpose (the encoding was right,
    #       the label VALUE was not), which is honest but is also exactly the
    #       state this loop exists to prevent becoming permanent.
    #
    #  DRIFT GUARD: asm.la now carries an internal size/emit invariant (SIZEDRIFT
    #  in ASSEMBLE): the sizing pass's total (TOTLEN) must equal the emitted
    #  length, else it halts loudly. It runs on EVERY assemble below, so these
    #  gates exercise its happy path continuously. Its RED path cannot have a
    #  standing gate — with the MOVSIZE fix in place, no program triggers drift —
    #  so it was verified by hand (revert MOVSIZE to the hardcoded 10, confirm it
    #  fires 56-vs-36 on asm_test_movlbl), the same inject-a-fault discipline the
    #  DRM capstones use. A future SIZEL/encoder desync now fails loudly here
    #  instead of silently misplacing every label after it.
    #       asm_test_macro joins them too: 928c745 added the fixture (push imm +
    #       %macro/%endmacro) but never wired it into build.sh, so a %macro
    #       regression would not have failed the build. Found by auditing gate
    #       coverage of every post-freeze commit, not just the one flagged red.
    #       asm_test_comma closes the LAST post-freeze hole: a52cf39 (a comma is
    #       a TOKEN; operands are comma-delimited groups) shipped with NO test.
    #       Its discriminating case is a spaced expression in a data directive
    #       (`dw gdt_end - gdt64 - 1` = ONE word) vs a comma list (`dw 1, 2` =

# WHY THE REJECT SIDE IS THE POINT: a corpus drawn from real .la files tests only
# ACCEPT, because those files contain only valid forms by construction. Grammar
# drift hides where the two disagree about what is MALFORMED. The corpus is

# assumed broken (a truncation can land on a still-valid program).

# It has already paid for itself: its first real run found the transcription said
# `export ident+` where parser.la does `ident*` (PARSE_EXPORT_NAMES falls through
# to PAIR(NIL)(s), so a bare `export` is legal). The parser was right, the spec
# was wrong -- caught BEFORE any LA module was built against it.

# Stage 3b adds a conservative mark-sweep collector to the native runtime: every
# heap object carries an 8-byte header (kind/mark/size), and rt_gc (triggered at
# allocator entry on exhaustion) marks from the verified root set (all GP regs +
# TRUEVAL/FALSEVAL + the stack), then sweeps unmarked 24-byte objects onto a
# free-list that the allocators reuse. HEADLINE: an int-forced tail loop at
# N=10,000,000 allocates ~0.8 GB of mostly-dead 24-byte objects (MEASURED; the old
# "~8 GB" was ~10x high) but COMPLETES in the 16 GiB heap. NOTE: completion alone
# is a VACUOUS check at 16 GiB (peak RSS ~252 MiB); part (a') below asserts the
# real property — bounded memory — as a scale-invariant RATIO.
# 16 GiB heap. Completion alone no longer proves reclamation here (~0.8 GB fits un-GC'd);
# part (a') asserts it via bounded peak RSS. The un-GC'd workload still runs the
# bump frontier off the end). 3b.3b adds blob reclamation: blobs round up to
# power-of-2 size-class free-lists (FREEBLOB), so a blob-churn loop is bounded too.
# 3b.4 native stack guard (the last Stage-3b piece): every compiled lambda body

# ★ The phonym column of each table is transcribed from the codex's printed
#   IPA; the compared value is DERIVED by the Operator Phonology. The two
#   have independent origins, so they can disagree — an expected column
#   produced by the code under test would assert nothing.
# ★ The collision scan is the first monosemy check ever run ACROSS the two
#   tables. Each was internally consistent, which is the condition under
#   which a collision survives.
# ★★ THE EXPECTED SET MOVED 2026-08-26 (R-D), from `agree=55 diverge=2
#   [Think Gratitude]` to `agree=43 diverge=14`. This is a DELIBERATE,
#   PRINCIPLED divergence, not drift, and the distinction is the whole point:
#   Erik ruled 2026-08-24 that an accent mark alone is insufficient to carry
#   the ⊗/▷ contrast, so ▷ now takes a tail DURATION mark ":" in the romanised
#   register (lexicon.la's PH, DIR branch). The codex's printed IPA PREDATES
#   that cue, so every ▷ entry must now differ from it.
#   ★ THE EXPECTATION IS DERIVED, NOT CAPTURED. The fourteen names are exactly
#   the LEX entries whose canonical form contains `>` (KAN's ▷), established by
#   an INDEPENDENT census before the change was made — not read back off the
#   new output. Think and Gratitude, the previous two divergences (vowel
#   elision), are themselves ▷ entries and are absorbed into the set rather
#   than added to it. If a future change makes some OTHER entry diverge, or
#   makes a ▷ entry agree, this goes red — which a bare count would not catch.
#   ⚠ What it means: the derivation and the codex now DISAGREE by construction
#   on ▷ entries. The codex is not wrong; it is older than the cue. Whether the
#   codex's printed forms should be reissued to carry ":" is Erik's call and is
#   NOT decided here.

# the data grammar, parses the SOURCE FILE THAT DEFINES the data grammar.
# ★ COMPOSED BY CONCATENATION, and the ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. `import("parser.la")`
#   binds nothing (parser.la has no `export` line), so this uses the same pattern
#   build.sh already uses for monosemy_test. parser.la and grammar.la have
#   INCOMPATIBLE list encodings — parser: NIL=PAIR(FALSE)(""), CONS=tagged pair;
#   grammar: Scott. Redefinition takes the FIRST binding, and GPARSE deconstructs its
#   token list Scott-style, so grammar.la MUST precede parser.la. Safe because
#   parser.la's LEXER region uses PAIR and strings only (zero NIL/CONS references,
#   verified). parser.la's own MAIN is trimmed or IT wins and parses kernel.la.
# ★ THE LEXER IS NOT RE-IMPLEMENTED — TOKENIZE drives parser.la's own NEXT_TOKEN.
#   A lexer written here could be tuned until the self-parse passed, which is
#   exactly the result this must not be.
# ★★ THE SUBJECT IS A DEFINITION-BOUNDARY PREFIX OF grammar.la, NOT THE WHOLE FILE,
#   and that is a bound this gate STATES rather than hides. grammar.la lexes to 1689
#   tokens; GPARSE's MATCH backtracks naively and P_MODULE is a STAR over an ALT, so
#   cost grows superlinearly. Measured on prefixes: 84 tok/2s · 145/5s · 209/7s ·
#   333/15s · 538/37s · 1689/1637s — accept=T and reject=F at EVERY size, INCLUDING
#   the whole file: the full 1689-token self-parse WAS witnessed, in 27 minutes.
#   ★ So the prefix here is a BUILD-TIME choice, not an unwitnessed-claim dodge —
#   27 min is ~15% on a 3 h build for a fact already established out of band. Run
#   grammar_l3.la against the whole file directly to reproduce it. Cost grows ~n^3.3.
#   The prefix is a prefix OF THE SELF, not a different corpus. Cut at a definition
#   boundary so a slice can never
#   end mid-definition — otherwise "rejected because truncated" and "rejected because
#   broken" are the same red.
# ★ THE REJECT ARM IS WHAT MAKES THE ACCEPT MEAN ANYTHING: a GPARSE returning TRUE
#   unconditionally would produce an identical accept. Prefixing an `eq` token starts
#   the stream with `=`, which no production can begin.

#  ★ IT IS NOT BOOKKEEPING, and entropy.la is the proof. Its NORM SORTED ⊗
#  operands — ontosynthesis treated as COMMUTATIVE, against tex:2837 — and commit
#  91fc923, which swept the codebase and "corrected five normalisers and two
#  renderers", COULD NOT have caught it, because nothing executed the file. An
#  unrun module is invisible to every gate by construction, so the ungated set is
#  where every other defect class goes to survive. Fixed, and it now has the arm.
#  ★ EACH ARM WAS RED-PATH TESTED BEFORE WIRING, by planting the defect it claims
#  to catch: trimono (both directions), siginj, phonorm, naming, entropy (both),
#  alethe, ontofelicity and dyadseed all flip, mostly one flag apiece. Wiring an
#  arm without that check would risk adding a fourth entry to this file's own

# ── ★★ MORE DEPTH IS NOT THE ANSWER ─────────────────────────────────────
#  archderive.la witnesses {I}'s closure at depth 4 and says so honestly. Depth 5,
#  6, 7 would still be finite witnessing. What makes it a proof for ALL depths is
#  CLOSURE UNDER THE GENERATOR: application is the only way to build a term from
#  the root, so if the class is closed under application, nothing outside it is
#  reachable at any depth. BASE + STEP + COVERAGE is that induction.
#  ★ THE CALL-BY-VALUE TRAP THIS HAD TO AVOID: `BEING(BEING)` reduces to `BEING`
#  at DEFINITION time, so enumerating terms as VALUES would make "all of them are
#  I" trivially true while proving nothing about coverage -- every tree would be
#  the same object before the check ran. The shapes are enumerated as Scott-encoded
#  DATA and evaluated by EVS; the shape space is real though its image is a point.
#  ★★ COVERAGE IS THE ARM THAT STOPS THIS BEING VACUOUS, and it was measured:
#  crippling the generator to split only at k=1 yields 5 shapes instead of 23 and
#  reds `cover` ALONE -- base, step and all stay green. Without it a crippled
#  generator prints "every shape is I: YES" and is indistinguishable from a
#  complete proof. The expected count comes from the CATALAN RECURRENCE computed
#  independently of the generator, so it is derived rather than pasted.
#  ★ RED PATH, both modes: breaking the root (BEING := la a. la b. a) HALTS the
#  module loudly with truncated output; crippling the generator reds coverage at
#  rc 0. Same two-mode shape as archderive's.
#  BOUND, and it does not go away: "is identity" is OBSERVATIONAL up to the probe
#  set -- a string, the EMPTY string, and a FUNCTION probe, so a term that is
#  identity on strings but not on functions fails. That is the sense the argument
#  needs (nothing EXTENSIONALLY distinct from I is reachable); it is not
#  intensional equality and the module does not claim it is.
#  SIZE: gated at NMAX=6 (65 shapes, ~14 s). NMAX=7 (197 shapes) is equally green
#  out of band at 218 s -- too much per build for corroboration of a fact the

# ── ★★ THE TERM THE CORPUS NEVER NAMED ──────────────────────────────────
#  Erik, 2026-08-27: euphemisms and meta-euphemisms create SEMANTIC OBSCURANTISM,
#  and it is a term the language should coin and use. Nothing in the corpus named
#  it. The definition is in LA's own machinery, not imported from linguistics:
#      OBSCURE(t) := SDEPTH(CANON(t)) > SDEPTH(NORMK(t))
#  a form carries AVOIDABLE DEPTH when it denotes the same concept as its own
#  canonical form and makes the hearer walk further to reach it. CANON is the
#  form AS UTTERED, NORMK the α=1 ontoglyph it collapses to; both are strings in
#  the same prefix notation, so one depth measure covers both.
#  ★★ WHY DEPTH AND NOT α<1 — AND THIS IS SETTLED BY MEASUREMENT, NOT ARGUMENT.
#  Every non-canonical form is α<1, INCLUDING ⊕(B,A) for ⊕(A,B). That is a
#  REORDERING — the same structure spelled another way — and calling it
#  obscurantism would make the term mean "not in normal form", which is not what
#  was named. The naive α-based definition was red-pathed against this module's
#  own corpus and FAILS the `spares` arm by flagging ⊕(B,A). The depth definition
#  spares it. So the coinage is discriminating rather than decorative.
#  ★ WHAT LA ALREADY FORBIDS: the WORD-LEVEL euphemism is UNCONSTRUCTIBLE, and
#  not by policy — a sealed monoglyph has REN ≡ κ∘ETYM BY CONSTRUCTION, so a name
#  cannot float free of its derivation. "Collateral damage" is unmintable: the
#  form would have to carry ⊗(killing,civilians) in its own body. Obscurantism can
#  therefore only enter as avoidable depth, which is detectable and removable.
#  RESULT: obscurantism is DETECTABLE AND REMOVABLE, NOT PREVENTABLE. The language
#  cannot stop a speaker uttering the deeper form; any hearer computes the α=1
#  form in one total pass, so obscuring is SELF-DEFEATING rather than forbidden.
#  BOUNDS, both stated in the module rather than left to be found later:
#   · detection is RELATIVE TO κ's DECLARED rewrite set — the same bound monosemy
#     carries, since full semantic equivalence is undecidable;
#   · the UTTERANCE level is outside the semantics BY RULING R-B. A technically
#     true composition assembled to mislead is a pragmatic act, LA does not model
#     it, so LA cannot forbid it. Banning implicature from the semantics also bans
#     misleading-by-implicature from what the language can police.
#  RED PATH MEASURED, three ways, each flipping only what it should: the naive
#  α definition reds `spares`; an OBSCURE that never fires reds `detects`; a blind

# ── LogosIPC over a SOCKET on the native VM: init forks a worker that messages back ──
# The real (VM-native) LogosInit pattern, now over an AF_UNIX SOCKET: init is the
# SERVER — CHANNEL("init") does socket + bind + listen on the rendezvous path
# BEFORE forking, so the worker's connect can't race ahead of accept; it then
# ACCEPTs (blocks for the worker) and RECVs the typed message. The worker is the
# CLIENT — CONNECT("init") then SEND — and exits; init decodes type/body, then
# reaps. logosipc.la is IMPORTED for real: codegen.la (running here as
# compiler.bin ON THE VM) resolves import("logosipc.la") at compile time
# (read_file is a VM builtin). The module exports CHANNEL/CONNECT/ACCEPT/SEND/
# RECV/MSG_*/ENCODE and keeps its Church/SEQ helpers private (mangled away), so
# the importer supplies its OWN IF/SEQ — a real multi-export module through the
# fully-native import path. A STALE file is seeded at the rendezvous path first:
# CHANNEL unlinks it before bind, so the message still gets through — proving the
# self-clean (with no unlink, bind would fail and nothing would arrive).

# holds a canary across a yield while task B churns ~400 MB (>> the 64 MB
# GC_INTERVAL), forcing the collector to fire while A is suspended; A's canary is
# byte-intact on resume ("SURVIVED"). This edited rt_gc (an early routine),

# It read: "its siblings gate_comp_session.sh, gate_hal1..5b, gate_hh1/2*,
# gate_k6*, gate_k7* all EXIST and PASS when run by hand, and build.sh invokes
# NONE of them (14 of 40 kernel gates are wired)."
# ★ The COUNT was never wrong — 14 kernel gates really are invoked above this
#   line, and the note 8 lines below correctly says 15 once gate_comp_term.sh
#   runs. What went false is the SENTENCE: the wiring block immediately below
#   now invokes every one of those siblings, so "invokes NONE of them" became
#   untrue while the parenthetical beside it stayed true. A local count read as
#   a global claim.
# ★ THE COST WAS NOT MISINFORMATION, IT WAS LABOUR. This sentence became a
#   memory ("52 of 78 gate scripts never invoked, incl. ALL HAL drivers"), the
#   memory became a queued work item, and the item was assigned and staffed —
#   to wire gates that were already wired.
# ★ MEASURED 2026-08-28, independently by two sessions, with controls (a
#   known-invoked and a known-uninvoked gate) checked BEFORE believing the
#   number: 52 gate scripts exist (12 root + 40 kernel); 50 are invoked; all 40
#   kernel gates run, from the block below. The two that are not are
#   gate_bootelf.sh (deliberate — a ~26-min native-VM cycle, invoked separately
#   like the QEMU gates) and gate_rss.sh (a real candidate, still unwired).
#   Method note, because three greps in a row got this wrong: a bare-name grep
#   matches gate names inside THIS comment, and a \b-anchored one silently
#   misses every ./gate_X.sh. Search per script, excluding existence-test and
#   comment lines, and check the pattern against both controls first.
# ★ So: state the number AND how it was measured, or state nothing. A count
#   hand-updated and never re-derived is how this one drifted.
