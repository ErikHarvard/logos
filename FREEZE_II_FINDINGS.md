# Freeze-Day Audit II — findings

**Scope:** everything since the last SECURED check (pre-Stage-4 hardening) — **187 commits**:
the trimodal layer, metaglyph, denote, pragmatics, deixis, glyphdag, the LA assembler and
linker, buildla, kernel K1–K7 and HAL. None systematically audited before now.

**The rule this serves** (Erik, 2026-08-19): *secure each milestone before building the next.*
Restated honestly and accepted: **"zero bugs" is not verifiable — "zero KNOWN bugs, plus a
bounded search that would have found them" is.** That distinction is load-bearing, because all
four previously-known vacuous gates were found BY ACCIDENT while looking at something else. A
clean run of a tool that cannot fail proves nothing.

## The four questions

| | question | why it exists |
|---|---|---|
| Q0 | what does the suite never run? | coverage is PRIOR to Q1/Q2 — neither can see a module never invoked |
| Q1 | where do two engines silently disagree? | the original method; 12 findings last time |
| Q2 | which assertions cannot go RED? | every known vacuous gate was found by accident, so the base rate is not four |
| Q3 | which loops can never terminate? | Track D's; found 4 kernel-killers Q1 and Q2 both structurally miss |

Q3 ran on Track D. **Q0 was added mid-audit** precisely because their findings proved Q1 and
Q2 could not have reached them.

## Q0 — coverage

**78 gate/build scripts tracked. `build.sh` invokes 26. FIFTY-TWO ARE NEVER INVOKED.**

- **Tier 1 — no script mentions them at all (19):** `buildla.la`, both `archive/` compilers, two
  `native_codegen3` variants, the `_live` demos, `kernel/paging_poke_smoke.la`, and 9 modules
  written 2026-08-18 and never gated.
- **Tier 2 — gated ONLY by a script `build.sh` never invokes (14):** the ENTIRE HAL driver layer —
  `ata`, `ata3b`, `pci`, `nic`, `nic5b`, `kbd`, `kbd2`, `fb`, `fb4b`, `comp`, `comp_session`,
  `ipc2`, `ipc_kernel`, `ipc_proc`.

⇒ **A green `./build.sh` says nothing about any driver.** A third shape beside "cannot fail" and
"never presented the failing input": *never asked at all.*

**HONEST BOUND:** many of the 52 are QEMU/hardware gates that cannot run unattended, so "not
invoked" is often BY DESIGN. The finding is that the suite's green covers 26 and the rest are
verified only when a human remembers — the exact condition that let `gate_bootelf` sit
stale-green for two commits.

**`buildla.la`** (Track D's find, confirmed and sharpened): it IS mentioned — in a COMMENT at
`kernel/build_k5b1.sh:10-11`. That script is itself among the 52. The only trace of the LA
reimplementation of `build.sh`, at 91/103 stages, is prose in an orphaned file.

**METHOD CAVEAT** (paid for by Track D): a parameterised reference (`kernel/${D}_ctrl.la`) is
invisible to a static sweep, miscounting in the SAFE-LOOKING direction. 63 unresolved expansions
are reported alongside the tiers rather than dropped.

### ★ Q0b — coverage cannot stop at "which scripts ran"

`gate_bootelf` was re-run at real `boot.asm` scale after the `equ` fix (1d2302e) and came back
**GREEN. The green is true and it never assembled a single one of the three `equ` sites.**

They sit inside a `%elifdef` chain in `.bootrun/asm_in.asm`. `BOOTELF.md`'s reproduce and the gate
both assemble with **no `-D` flags**, so no arm is taken and the defective construct is removed by
the preprocessor before the assembler sees it. Measured, `nasm -f elf64 -i .bootrun/ -i kernel/`:

| flags | `hh_msg_len` | `hh2_ok_len` | `hh2_bad_len` |
|---|---|---|---|
| *(none — what the gate runs)* | compiled out | compiled out | compiled out |
| `-D HH1` | `41B904000000` | compiled out | compiled out |
| `-D HH2` | compiled out | `41B917000000` | `41B918000000` |

All three are the short form `41 B9 imm32` = `mov r9d`; the defect was `49 B9` + imm64 (`movabs`,
10 bytes). The 5-byte delta is the same one Track B's e2e fixture showed as 845 → 840 bytes.

**The class:** not a gate that cannot fail, and not a gate never asked — *a gate that assembles a
configuration in which the defective construct does not exist.* It ran, compared real objects, and
was correct about them. Observed by Track B; the sharpened form:

> With mutually exclusive arms, **full coverage of a file is not achievable in one build at all**,
> so a coverage question phrased per-gate cannot express the requirement. It must be **per-arm**,
> and the arm set **enumerated by assembling each arm and observing** — not by reading the
> directives. Reading them is exactly what got the arms wrong twice.

Twice, concretely, and the *independence* is the load-bearing part. Track B's first parser matched
`%ifdef`/`%ifndef` but not `%elifdef`, never popped, and named the opening arm. My own first reading
then put all three sites under `HH1` — they are under **two** arms, so the obvious fix
(`%define HH1`) would exercise **one site of three and report green**. Only assembling each arm
showed it.

> Two readers failed **independently, by different mechanisms, on the same input**. One misread is
> an error in the reader. Two independent misreads mean **the directives are not reliably readable
> by inspection at all** — a property of the artifact, not of anyone's carefulness. That is why
> assembling each arm and observing is not merely the safer enumeration but the only sound one, and
> it generalises to every conditionally-assembled file in the tree, not just this one.

(Sharpening owed to Track B, who pointed out my first filing understated its own strongest sentence.)

**★ THE ARMS ARE NOT VARIANTS OF A PROGRAM — THEY ARE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS.** `HH2` does not embed
the LA image at all: it has four sections where `NONE`/`HH1` have five, missing `.la_image`, with
`.bss` and `.boot32` both growing downstream of that. Confirmed independently on Track B's fixture,
where every *number* differs from mine (their `.la_image` is the frozen 256-byte stub, mine the real
12373-byte image) and the *structure* is identical. So `%define HH2` selects a materially different
build, which is precisely why per-arm coverage was never optional: **a per-gate coverage claim would
have been wrong about HH2 in a way no amount of care on the HH1 side could reveal.**

**NONE-arm result (Track B, verified against my fixture):** `asm.la` matches nasm **semantically**
on the boot fixture — 53 relocations identical on offset/type/symbol/addend, all sections identical
outside relocated fields. Their first comparator reported `FAIL .boot32 differs … byte 10` at
identical sizes, which reads exactly like an encoding defect in the least-trusted component. It is
not one: **nasm zeroes a relocated field and carries the value in the RELA addend; `asm.la` writes it
inline; `ld` overwrites with S+A either way.** Confirmed independently here — offset `0x08`
addend `a000`, field bytes `00000000`.

`asmelfobj.la`'s own header already prescribes this: *"THE GATE IS ONE LEVEL UP: `ld(ours) ==
ld(nasm)`, not byte-identity of the `.o`."* **The comparator contradicted the documented gate of the
thing it compared** — which vindicates `gate_bootelf`'s level rather than changing it, since at
`ld` level the convention difference cannot arise.

**Per-arm, a third time — the arms do not exercise the same RELOCATION TYPES either:**

| arm | relocs | `R_X86_64_32` | `_32S` | `_64` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NONE | 63 | 21 | **1** | 41 |
| HH1 | 70 | 27 | **1** | 42 |
| HH2 | 94 | 36 | **17** | 41 |

`_32`/`_32S` are 4-byte fields, `_64` is **8-byte** — a masker assuming uniform 4-byte width
under-masks all 41 `_64` entries by four bytes each. And a masker whose handled-type set was learned
from the NONE arm meets `_32S` **seventeen times** in HH2, where a refusal would read as an HH2
defect rather than a masker gap. Section sets, coverage, and now relocation types: **per-arm is not
a property of one dimension, it is a property of conditional assembly.**

**Design note worth preserving:** three relocations per arm have **addend == 0**, so for those "the
field is zeroed" is indistinguishable from "the value is genuinely zero". Anything *detecting* the
convention from the data is fooled by them; keying the mask on relocation **position** is immune.
The detector version is the tempting simplification and it is wrong.

### ★★★ Q0b PRODUCED A REAL DEFECT — `asm.la` drops the high 32 bits of the higher-half base

Per-arm coverage stopped being methodology and found a kernel-killing encoding bug. **The equ sites
themselves PASS** — HH1's `hh_msg_len` encodes `41 B9 04 00 00 00` in both. The defect is a
different instruction in the same arm:

    source   mov rax, HIGH_BASE          HIGH_BASE equ 0xFFFFFFFF80000000
    nasm     48 C7 C0 00 00 00 80  (7 B)  ->  rax = 0xFFFFFFFF80000000   ✓
    asm.la   B8 00 00 00 80        (5 B)  ->  rax = 0x0000000080000000   ✗

Verified here from the disassembler: `48C7C000000080` = `mov rax,0xffffffff80000000`;
`B800000080` = `mov eax,0x80000000`, which **zero-extends**. A kernel built through this path
computes its high alias as `0x80000000`, then jumps and sets its stack into the low half and does
not survive the transition. The 2-byte shortfall also cascades — `call rel32` displacements and six
`R_X86_64_64` addends all shift by 2.

**ROOT CAUSE — the encoder implements two of NASM's three `mov r64, imm` forms:**

| immediate fits | NASM emits | in `asm.la`? |
|---|---|---|
| unsigned 32 | `B8+r imm32` (zero-extends) | ✔ |
| **signed 32 only** (negative / high half) | **`REX.W C7 /0 imm32`** (sign-extends) | **✘ ABSENT** |
| neither | `REX.W B8+r imm64` (movabs) | ✔ |

`MOVIMM` (`asm.la:388`) branches only on operand WIDTH — `w=1` → `0xB0+r`, `w=2` → `66 B8+r`,
else → `B8+r imm32`. **There is no `C7 /0` register-direct branch at all** (`C7 /0` exists in the
file only for immediate-to-MEMORY). So `0xFFFFFFFF80000000` truncates to `0x80000000`, "fits in
unsigned 32", and takes the short form.

**And the file's own header states the incomplete rule as complete** — *"when the immediate fits in
unsigned 32 bits NASM takes the shorter form and drops REX.W entirely"* — accurate about what the
code does, silent about the case it omits. **The governing law again: an asserted claim inside the
apparatus, wrong by omission, with nothing witnessing the gap** because a signed-32-only immediate
never appears in the no-flag build.

**BLAST RADIUS IS WIDER THAN THE ARMS UNDER TEST.** Enumerated from source: **eleven**
`mov rax, HIGH_BASE` sites across **five** arms — HH1(1), HH1B(2), HH2(2), HH2B(2), HH2C(4) — and
**zero in NONE**. Every one is the higher-half transition, the instruction that must be right for the
kernel to survive the jump.

**★ AND THE ARM SET IS 22, NOT 2.** Enumerated from the fixture:

    HAL2B HAL4 HH1 HH1B HH1_HIGHMAP HH2 HH2B HH2C HH2_PTS IPC K2_FAULT K4C_WX
    K5B2 K5B2_DBG K5_TIMER K6A K6B K6C K6C2 K6C3 LA_RING3_IMAGE RING3

An entire evening's two-arm argument ran on a fixture with 22 conditional symbols; neither track had
heard of `HH1B` an hour before it turned out to reach two of the defective sites. **The enumeration
principle stated four times tonight was itself running on an assumed enumeration** — fifth instance,
and the most expensive.

⇒ **Q0b's finding is no longer "coverage must be per-arm."** It is: **per-arm coverage over an arm
set enumerated FROM SOURCE finds real bugs the shipped gate cannot see.** The gate that has been
running is correct and clean on NONE, and would never have found this at any level of care.

**★ FOUR ADJACENT SITES THAT LOOK IDENTICAL AND ARE CORRECT — do not widen the fix to them.**
`mov rax, METAL_FLAG_ABS` appears at 453, 837, 967, 1132: same instruction shape, same
symbolic-constant form. **`B8 imm32` is the RIGHT encoding there.** `METAL_FLAG_ABS` is derived by
`kernel/build_k6b.sh` as *rt listing offset + `0x400078`* — a low address of the same magnitude as
`LA_ENTRY` (`0x410a9e` frozen, `0x402fb6` live), comfortably inside unsigned 32, where zero-extension
is correct. So the fix must key on **"fits unsigned 32"**, not on "looks like a big symbolic
constant": `HIGH_BASE` (`0xFFFFFFFF80000000`) fails that test, `METAL_FLAG_ABS` passes it. A fix
widened to all symbolic immediates would break four correct sites *and* regress the byte-identity
that took months to reach. (Exclusion owed to Track B, who checked rather than assuming the radius
was 15.)

**★ THE ARM SET IS NOT FLAT — SOME ARMS CARRY DEPENDENCIES AND CANNOT BE BUILT AS LISTED.** `HH2B`
and `HH2C` fail with `symbol 'METAL_FLAG_ABS' not defined`. Sharper than "they need a derived
symbol": **neither the frozen `.bootrun/entry.inc` NOR the live `kernel/entry.inc` defines it** —
both carry only `LA_ENTRY`. It exists solely after `build_k6b.sh` runs and writes it. So an
enumeration by *reading guards* lists 22 arms, several of which **no one can assemble** without
first running a build step the enumeration never mentions. That is the dependency-set principle one
level above the include files that bit both tracks — and it is why Track B **assembled** the 11-site
census rather than accepting my guard-resolved reading of it. The two agree site-for-site; the
reading is now witnessed, which matters for a number going into a freeze filing.

**Also visible in passing:** frozen `LA_ENTRY` is `0x410a9e`, live is `0x402fb6`. The frozen fixture
is a materially different program state, which is the scope caveat above made concrete rather than
asserted.

**NOT FIXED.** The correct encoding decision belongs in daylight, not at 22:10 with three VMs live
and a `build.sh` regression mid-flight on the same tree.

**Open, not closed.** Track B is running both arms through `asm.la` for the LA-side encodings.
`asm.la` implements `%elifdef` correctly (`asm.la:1874`, tracking whether a level has already
fired — `asm.la:1795`), so that comparison is about encoding rather than preprocessing.

**Second scope gap, stated rather than left implicit:** `.bootrun/` is frozen at 2026-07-18, so
the gate cannot see an `equ` regression introduced into `kernel/boot.asm` after that date.

## Q2 — which assertions cannot go RED

**All 238 flagged assertions resolved. Zero vacuous.** 211 Z-unclassified → 196 resolved
mechanically, 15 by hand. The bulk are the `echo "FAIL ..."` arm of a multi-line `if/else`; the
discriminating comparison sits lines above, so a per-line classifier sees only the message.
Walking back to the **governing test**: B-exact-string 118, D-exit+diag 73, A 1, C 1, F 3.

Three of the 15 are the **strongest gates in the suite** — they assert something SHOULD fail:
`build.sh:1428`, `:1481` (asm.la must REJECT malformed input), `:2504` (the compiler must halt
on an unsupported name).

**The one real weakness:** 34 presence checks use `[ -f ]`/`[ -x ]`; **zero use `[ -s ]`**, so each
passes on a ZERO-BYTE file. None stands alone — `logos_native` is checked for presence, then
exact size 171, then executed, then output and exit code compared. *Weak in isolation, not used
in isolation.*

**Q2b — toothless non-vacuity guards.** Two cuts of the detector were WRONG and its positive
control caught both. The real signature is a guard **whose zero-case exits 0**:

    if [ "$found" -eq 0 ]; then echo "SKIP ..."; exit 0; fi

The guard fires correctly and is discarded. **The detector refuses to print results unless it
first fires on the known-bad `gate_hal_idle.sh` and stays silent on the fixed one.** Zero
instances in this tree.

## Q1 — cross-engine divergence

| probe | result |
|---|---|
| UTF-8 strings | **agree** byte-for-byte, 4 engines |
| integer wrap | **agree** at every 64-bit boundary |
| deep recursion | **agree** where measurable |
| `chr` / `ord` | **★ REAL GAP** |

**Confirmed for the first time:** LA strings are BYTE sequences, consistently across engines
(`str_len("⊗↻∃") = 9`) — the trimodal sigils are safe under it. And `tiny_host`'s
unsigned-arithmetic wrap genuinely matches the VM, previously justified by a source comment and
never tested.

**THE FINDING:**

    tiny_host.c · secd.asm · native_codegen3.la   HAVE chr/ord
    eval.la · bytecode.la (RUN_BYTES, RUN_SM)     DO NOT — `unbound variable`

`build.sh:101`, titled *"binary-safe primitives (chr / ord / write_exec)"*, ran `./tiny_host`
ALONE. **FIXED:** the gate now asserts the whole DISTRIBUTION, with absence witnessed by its
DIAGNOSTIC rather than by empty output — an engine returning something *wrong* would otherwise
pass as still-absent. Red-pathed both directions; a timeout is unjudgeable with its own FAIL.

Qualifications kept attached: it fails LOUDLY; the ROADMAP's claim is *"host vs VM"* and both
have them, so it stands; the omission may be deliberate.

**NOT DONE deliberately:** implementing `chr`/`ord` in the three interpreters — new feature work,
and the freeze permits closing work only.

## ★ The methodological result

**Three separate times an EMPTY result looked exactly like a cross-engine divergence and was my
own harness timing out** — once it would have been reported as a UTF-8 defect in the newest layer.
Each time the discriminator was asking *why* empty, never the mismatch itself. The harness now
reports `<TIMEOUT Ns>` explicitly: a limit of the instrument must never be readable as a property
of the thing measured.

**★ A CLAIM ABOUT WORK-STATE OUTLIVES THE WORK UNLESS SOMETHING FORCES IT TO STAY TRUE.** Twice in
this one audit, across two tracks. The stale VM constant `13775` was fixed independently on both
branches (`1767b77`, `51c0fbf`) because neither branch's record showed the other was on it. Commit
`1d2302e` said `gate_bootelf` was "still owed" after the run had already come back green, and Track
B was minutes from spending 26 minutes re-deriving it. Both are prose asserting a state of the work;
neither had anything checking it still held. Twice makes it a pattern, not a slip — and it is the
[[prose]] class again, one level up: not a claim about the code, a claim about the *status* of the
code. The only known counter is a cross-track look before starting anything expensive, which is what
caught this one.

**★ AN INSTRUMENT THAT REPORTS ABSENCE MUST FIRST PROVE IT LOOKED.** Five instruments in one day,
in one area, reported *absence* while simply being broken: `gate_bootelf`'s silent mechanism print
(nothing to print — the branch was compiled out); Track B's `%elifdef` parser (named the wrong
arm); my `nasm` listing grep with `-i` omitted — nasm died on missing includes, wrote no listing,
and the grep over the nonexistent file printed "NOTHING EMITTED" for all three symbols under all
three flag settings, *exactly the predicted result, for an unrelated reason*; and Track B's
`unbound variable 'poke'`, which meant wrong engine, not missing feature.

A **fifth** landed hours later, and it is the best evidence for the rule because it caught the
rule's own author on its first live exercise: Track B's arm-runner staged a fixture missing the five
`%include`/`incbin` dependencies. Same failure as my missing `-i`, by the opposite route — **I lost
the include PATH, they lost the include FILES.** Both arms launched with the unpatched script
because the fix landed ~20 seconds after the launcher fired; the guard, not the fix, is what held.
Without it, each arm would have assembled a truncated fixture, compared it against a nasm control
built from the *same* truncated source, and **both sides would have agreed** — a clean PASS on a
program that is not the one under test.

A **sixth**, in the comparator rather than the fixture, found while checking the above: this fixture
has **no `.text` section at all** — the code is in `.multiboot`/`.boot32`/`.rodata`. An
`objcopy --only-section=.text` extracts nothing from both sides, **and two empty files compare
equal**. A `.text`-keyed identity check therefore does not miss the code, it *passes vacuously*.

**Companion clause, owed to Track B:** *observe, AND prove you assembled the whole thing.* A fixture
missing its includes is not a smaller program — it is a **different program, with no `equ` sites in
it at all**, which is Q0b's defect class reached from a third direction. Assert the dependency set
directly rather than relying on a downstream tool to notice, because which tool notices first is
luck about tool ordering, not a property of the check.

**The guard bounds the damage; it does not locate the fault.** The `.text` comparator would not have
passed vacuously on Track B's side — their `[ -s ]` check would have caught the empty extract and
refused. But *refusing is not reporting*: the delivery would have been three arms of red that looked
like an `asm.la` defect and was actually a comparator naming a section that does not exist. **Same
dead harness, opposite sign** — the absence rule protects against false confirms, and here the same
break produced a false *accusation*. A red that names the wrong subject is still a wrong finding and
it costs the accused party real work. Say what refused and why, or the refusal migrates to the
nearest plausible culprit.

**Corollary (Track B): a refusal must NAME WHAT REFUSED AND WHY, or it migrates to the nearest
plausible culprit — and unattributed refusals do not land uniformly, they land on whatever is
NEWEST.** Theirs was going to land on `asm.la`, the one component in the chain nobody had reason to
trust yet. The newest thing in a chain is the least defended against a misattributed red.

**★ THE GENERAL FORM, after three repetitions:** proving you looked is necessary but not sufficient —
you must look at the *right thing*, and **the identifier for "the right thing" must be derived from
the artifact, never supplied by the observer.** Three instances now: the **arm** set (enumerate by
assembling, not by reading directives), the **section** set (enumerate from the object, not by
assuming `.text`), and the **dependency** set (assert the fixture's includes directly, not by
waiting for nasm to complain). Each time the observer supplied a name the artifact never confirmed.

Measured consequence, worth carrying: **the three arms do not share a section set.** NONE and HH1
have five (`.multiboot`/`.boot32`/`.rodata`/`.bss`/`.la_image`); **HH2 has four — no `.la_image`** —
and its `.bss` nearly doubles. So an expected set inherited across arms produces a spurious finding
on HH2. The expected set is per-object, on both sides of each comparison.

**What real corroboration looks like, by contrast.** Track B re-measured the section sets on their
own fixture: every number differed from mine, the structure matched exactly. **Two different
artifacts measured separately** — not two instances agreeing. That is the form worth having, and it
is the exact inverse of today's doubles, all of which were agreement *without* measurement.

**★ A DOCUMENTED HAZARD IS NOT A DEFENDED ONE — and the executable remedy reproduced the defect.**
Track B's `LINKER.md:811` is their own entry titled *"I REINTRODUCED THIS FILE'S OWN DOCUMENTED
`strtonum` TRAP"*, concluding: *"Knowing the trap and having written it down did not prevent
repeating it; only RUNNING the check did."* So the doc failed **both ways — unreachable for the
other track, ineffective for its own author.** That kills relocation as a remedy: moving prose to
where everyone can read it fixes only the half that already has a counterexample.

The executable form built to fix it, `~/logos-guards/check_env.sh`, **cannot fail**: `fail=0` at
line 18, `exit $fail` at line 51, nothing between ever assigns to it — measured by running it, exit
code 0. Every branch calls `note()`. Its offered usage is `sh check_env.sh || exit 1`, which reads
as a gate. **It is documentation with a shebang** — the same prose, routed to stdout instead of a
`.md`. The remedy for "a documented hazard is not a defended one" reproduces the defect it names,
one layer up. Reachability was a real problem and a separate repo genuinely solves it; this is the
other half, and it is the [[a check that can't fail isn't a check]] class arriving inside the tool
built to prevent that class.

**★ THE PROGRESSION IS THE LEDGER IN MINIATURE — three revisions, three distinct defect classes, on
a 50-line script, each found only by RUNNING it:**

| | defect | found by |
|---|---|---|
| v1 | **could not fail** — `fail=0`, never assigned, `exit $fail` | `echo $?` |
| v2 | **could not discriminate** — selftest proved each scanner *could* fire, never that it fires *selectively*; 3 FAILs on real code, all false (comments *warning about* `strtonum`; `.text` on ld output, which does have it; `sed 's/^ *\[[ 0-9]*\] *//'` read as bash `[[`) | running it on real code |
| v3 | **coverage number cannot distinguish a rule with 94 inputs from one with 1** | running it on a *second tree* |

v3 is otherwise the right shape: positive **and** negative controls per rule, `exit 2` refusing to
report at all if a scanner cannot stay green on a lookalike, and an absence check that fails when no
scripts were found. But on `kernel-k1` the shebang census is **89 `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, 3
`#!/bin/bash`, 1 `#!/bin/sh`** — and the bashism rule only examines `#!/bin/sh` files. **Its PASS is
a statement about one file while the report says "scanned: 94".**

⇒ **The absence guard proves something was looked at; it does not prove THIS RULE had input.** The
denominator must be **per-rule**, derived from the artifact — the enumeration principle a *fourth*
time (arm set, section set, dependency set, applicability set). Each time one number was supplied
where the artifact has several. Fix: each scanner reports its own `n`, so `PASS (n=1)` is visibly
not defending much instead of hiding behind a shared 94.

**★ AN EARNED GREEN AND AN UNTESTED GREEN PRINT IDENTICALLY — and the difference is measurable.**
`n` (files a rule saw) does not say whether any of them was *discriminating*: a rule can have n=94
and never meet a hard case, and "it did not fire" is not evidence it would not have. The missing
number comes from the same scan — **k = the near-misses the rule met on REAL input and correctly
declined** (for the bashism rule: any `[[`/`<(` in a `#!/bin/sh` file, minus the rule's own
command-position matches). Measured:

| tree | n | violations | k | reading |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `kernel-k1` | 1 | 0 | **0** | never met a hard case — green is **untested** |
| `track-b` | 18 | 0 | **8** | met the exact case that broke v2, eight times, stayed green — **earned** |
| `track-d` | 7 | 0 | **0** | green is **untested** |

track-b's k=8 is the eight `sed` bracket expressions Track B named *before* this was run — ground
truth not supplied to the measure. Report it as `PASS (n=1, k=0)` with **k=0 stated as "never met a
hard case"**, not as a FAIL (a rule may legitimately be unexercised) but never printing the same as
k=8. **Limit, so it is not oversold:** k only counts lookalikes for the chosen "loose" pattern; a
construct neither pattern anticipates is invisible to both, so synthetic negative controls remain
necessary. k covers real-corpus discrimination, which was the missing half.

**★ THE TELL FOR WHEN TO DELETE A CONTROL (Track B):** *you are editing the rule in response to what
it FOUND rather than to what it SHOULD find.* A rule narrowed until it stops complaining is v1 by a
slower route — which retro-diagnoses the vacuous gates already in this ledger: it explains why each
looks reasonable in isolation and only fails when you ask what it can no longer catch.

**★ PROSE IS NOT A DEFENCE EVEN WHEN IT IS UNMISSABLE — reachability was never the binding
constraint.** The fifth double had the warning **delivered directly, naming the exact construct,
seconds earlier**, and it still did not prevent the repeat: Track B hit the `grep -c` trap in the
very computation the warning was about, in the message they were replying to. `LINKER.md:811` for
the third time today, now with delivery removed as a variable. This **demotes the branch-local
distribution finding above to a contributing factor** — it was real, but plainly not the cause.
Only an executable check has ever prevented one of these.

**Loud failure beats quiet correctness, and today proved it in one run.** Track B's broken k
computation produced *both* failure modes simultaneously: a plausible wrong number (`k=2` for
track-b, where the true value is 8) **and** a shell syntax error. **The crash is the only reason the
wrong number was not reported** — nothing about `k=2` would have invited doubt. `wc -l` always exits
0; `grep -c` prints its count and exits 1 on zero matches. Prefer the construct that cannot fail
quietly.

**★ THE TRAP IS IN COMMITTED CODE, and asking that was the whole value.** We hit `grep -c`'s exit-1
twice in ad-hoc commands; nobody asked whether gates carry it. They do:

- `build.sh:5263` — `RECON_GLYPHS="$(grep -c ... || echo 0)"`, present in **all three trees**.
  Traced all three cases: it **cannot produce a false PASS** (a zero-match yields `"0\n0"`, which
  makes `[ ... -eq ... ]` a shell error that takes the FAIL branch), and an explicit `[ -f ... ]`
  check two lines below already covers the missing-file case the fallback was written for.
  **Redundant and wrong, but harmless — a latent wart, not a defect.** Recording it at that severity
  deliberately; inflating it would be the false-accusation failure this ledger keeps naming.
- **The adjacent case is worse.** `build.sh` runs `set -euo pipefail`, and **2 bare
  `$(grep -c ...)` assignments** have no guard (`build.sh:1263`, `:5262`). Under `set -e` a
  zero-match makes the *assignment* fail and **aborts the whole build with exit 1 and no
  diagnostic** — not a false green, an **undiagnosable red**. This is the same bug fixed earlier
  today in the chr/ord gate (`7 PASS, 0 FAIL, exit 1`); that fix was applied to the instance and the
  pattern was never swept for. **Fixing an instance is not fixing a class.**

  **Correction, recorded because the wrong number was filed first:** I originally reported **14**.
  That conflated *every* `$(grep -c ...)` substitution with the risky subset. Measured, the three
  contexts behave differently under `set -e`:

  | context | zero-match behaviour | measured |
  |---|---|---|
  | `NG=$(grep -c ...)` | **aborts**, exit 1, nothing after runs | ✔ |
  | `[ "$(grep -c ...)" -gt 0 ]` | does not abort — `[`'s status governs | ✔ |
  | `echo "$(grep -c ...)"` | does not abort | ✔ |

  So the tree has **3 assignments, 1 of them guarded → 2 exposed**, and 11 harmless uses. Track B
  independently counted **2** on their branch; the counts agree once the contexts are separated.
  Filing a number derived from the wrong scan, in the ledger that keeps finding unwitnessed prose,
  is the same defect one level up — and it survived until a peer's different corpus forced the
  recount.

  Combined with the refusal corollary, the cost is worse than an abort: a build dying at line 1263
  with no message **gets blamed on whatever changed most recently.** The trap does not merely fail —
  it accuses the wrong component.

**★ WHY THE CROSS-CHECK WORKS, stated mechanically:** four for four today, **neither track found its
own defect.** Track B caught my sed-bracket exposure because track-b *has* eight; I caught their
denominator because `kernel-k1` has exactly one `#!/bin/sh` file. Neither insight required being
smarter — **it required a different corpus.** That is also why two instances agreeing is not
evidence: the corpora are independent, the reasoners are not.

**★ AND WHEN A CONTROL CANNOT DISCRIMINATE, DELETE IT AND SAY SO WHERE THE NEXT PERSON LOOKS — do
not tune it down.** Track B removed the `.text` rule outright: `--only-section=.text` is wrong on the
kernel object fixtures and correct on `ld` output, and **nothing in the source line says which**, so
it cannot be judged statically at all. Shipping it would ship the false-accusation machine. It is
recorded in the scanner's header as a known-unjudgeable construct instead. This is the first time in
this audit a check was *removed* rather than weakened until it stopped complaining.

**Self-correction, recorded because it is the same class:** I reported my own sketch as
discriminating — "6 `[[ ` hits, all in bash files, correctly not flagged." **My tree contains zero
sed-bracket lookalikes in `#!/bin/sh` files, so my scan never faced the case that broke v2.** The
six were excluded by the shebang filter, which is trivially right. I described an accident of a clean
tree as a property of the check, one message after asserting that reading is not measuring.

**The correction is to test the CALLER, not the environment.** "Does this box's `awk` have
`strtonum`" is a fact about the box, and defending on it still requires someone to remember — the
thing that already failed twice. **"Does any gate script CALL `strtonum`" is a fact about the code
and defends the author who forgot.** Likewise `--only-section=.text`, and `[[ `/`<(` inside
`#!/bin/sh` files. Run against `kernel-k1`: 0 `strtonum`, 0 `.text`-keyed `objcopy` (it would have
caught mine had I committed it), 6 `[[ ` — **all in `#!/bin/bash` files and correctly not flagged.**
It discriminates, and it has a RED it can actually reach.

**★ A FOURTH DOUBLE, AND IT IS A DISTRIBUTION PROBLEM, NOT A CARELESSNESS ONE.** We each walked
into `mawk` having no `strtonum` (a gawk extension; `/usr/bin/awk` -> `mawk 1.3.4` tree-wide). Track
B notes it is already documented — in `LINKER.md`. **`LINKER.md` does not exist on `kernel-k1`; it is
a track-b file.** So the hazard was written down in a place structurally unreachable from the branch
that needed it. That is the `13775` shape again: **branch-local knowledge is invisible to peers**, and
the remedy is not "read the docs" but *a hazard that applies tree-wide must not live in a
branch-local file.* Environment facts — which `awk`, which shell, which section names — belong
somewhere every track can see.

**★ AND A LIMIT ON CROSS-TRACK CHECKING ITSELF.** Two tracks are two instances of the same model
reasoning from the same conventions: they do not fail randomly, they fail **correlatedly**. So one
track confirming another is *not* independent evidence, and today's three doubles are what that looks
like from inside. What is independent is the artifact — `readelf` on the object, nasm's listing, the
emitted bytes. Every real advance today came from running a command against the artifact; every wrong
turn came from reading and reasoning about it. Operating rule: **agreement is not evidence — when two
tracks agree, that is the moment to go measure.**

**Three independent doubles now** — two `%elifdef` misreads, two `13775` fixes, two lost-include
failures. Each pair was two people failing separately on the same thing by different mechanisms.
That is not coincidence; it is what a shared blind spot looks like from inside, and it is the
argument for the cross-track look being routine rather than occasional.

Right answer, wrong mechanism, agreeing with the hypothesis — the most dangerous confirm there is,
and the failure the timeout finding above is a special case of. **Assert the artifact exists and is
non-empty before drawing any conclusion from what is not in it.** All four would have been caught
by that one discipline. The `[ -s file ] || refuse` guard is the minimum form.

**RUN_SM costs ~100 s per recursion level** (28 s base case, 126 s for one call), so it times out
on almost any interesting program. Stated, not rediscovered.

**A fourth question belongs beside Q2**, proposed by Track D: *which controls cannot fail?* Three
independent hits in one day — a sign-flip control (arithmetic, cannot move), a control moving two
variables (isolates neither), and `gate_link_e2e` comparing across both tracks' halves (names the
wrong one). A comparison that cannot discriminate is the general form, and neither Q1 nor Q2 asks
for it.

## ★★ The governing law this audit converged on

> **The remedy is written in the same medium as the disease, so it inherits the disease unless every
> claim in it is derived.** (Track B)

Every failure in this ledger is an instance. The apparatus built to eliminate asserted claims kept
making asserted claims:

| the apparatus | the asserted claim inside it |
|---|---|
| `check_env.sh` v1 — built to replace prose with a test | `exit $fail` *looked* like a check; `fail` was never assigned |
| `check_gates.sh` selftest banner | hardcoded `2 rules` after a third was added — prose drift **inside the prose-drift remedy** |
| this findings file | I filed **14** unguarded `grep -c` assignments; the measured number is **2** |
| `gate_bootelf`'s green | the commit message said "still owed" after the run had already passed |
| `LINKER.md`'s `strtonum` warning | did not defend its own author, in its own file |
| my regression waiter (written *after* filing all of the above) | reported **VERDICT: GREEN** on a run still executing |
| `git push` | reports success while the deliverable stays untracked on local disk |
| my own asm suite | reported "23 pass, 2 skip" — the 2 never ran because I copied fixtures without their includes |

**The only escape is that every number a check prints must be COMPUTED by the check** — `3 rules, 3
positive + 5 negative controls` derived from the registered controls, `n=` and `k=` derived per rule
from the corpus. A claim a human typed is a claim nothing keeps true.

**Corollary on line numbers:** the same two `grep -c` constructs sit at `1263`/`5262` on
`kernel-k1`, `1217`/`4954` on track-b, `1246`/`4721` on track-d — one shared ancestor drifting per
branch. **Any finding filed by line number is already stale on the other two branches.** File
constructs and filenames; line numbers do not travel.

**Operational note that nearly cost this audit its own regression:** `/bin/sh` reads a script lazily
by byte offset, so **editing a running `build.sh` corrupts it mid-execution.** Track B flagged it
because track-d had a run in flight; it applied harder here — this session's own hour-long
regression *is* a `build.sh` run on `kernel-k1`. The two-line `grep -c` fix waits for the run to
land. "The fix is trivial" is precisely the reasoning that makes people do it anyway.

## ★★★ The night's thesis landing on the night's own tooling

Three more instruments failed *after* every rule above was written down. This is the
strongest evidence in the ledger that **stating a principle does not install it.**

**1. My regression waiter reported GREEN on a run that was still executing.** Two
independent defects, either sufficient alone:
- **Wrong PID.** `ps | grep '[b]ash build.sh' | head -1` picked an unrelated process;
  `head -1` took it because it sorted first. The real regression was a child of the
  `unshare -rm --propagation private` wrapper. The watched process's exit meant nothing.
- **The "completion marker" was not one.** `∃(∃) ≡ ∃` is the project motto and appears
  inside ordinary PASS lines — 5 occurrences, none terminal. The check asked `count >= 1`,
  satisfiable at any point mid-run. Correct test: `grep -c '^∃(∃) ≡ ∃$'`, the bare line
  `build.sh` prints as its last statement, which cannot match PASS text.

**What caught it was reading the ARTIFACT, not the instrument** — the log's last line was
`PASS K4b` with ~12 gates unrun, contradicting the verdict. Had the check been trusted, a
commit would have landed against an unfinished run.

**2. `git push` reports success while the deliverable stays untracked** (Track B). A
209-line finding shipped pointing at a fix that existed only on local disk. `git push` is
the one green nobody re-checks. **`git ls-files --error-unmatch` before pushing belongs in
the guard, not in anyone's habits.**

**3. My asm suite silently skipped 2 of 25 fixtures.** It reported "23 pass, 0 fail, 2 skip"
and I described the skips as nasm refusing them, "independent of `asm.la`, pre-existing."
Both false: `asm_test_pp` needs `%include "ppinc.inc"` and `asm_test_sect` needs
`incbin "incdata.bin"`, and I had copied the `.asm` files to a scratch dir **without their
dependencies**. The canonical gate, run in the real tree, passes all 25 with zero skips.
**Third instance of lost-dependencies in one session** — Track B lost the include files, I
lost the include path, then I lost the include files too.

**★ THE ACTUAL FINDING, in Track B's words, and it outranks the enumeration principle it
explains:**

> The lesson is not hard to state; it is hard to **recognise in a new costume.**

Enumerating by symbol gave a wrong answer three times (the arm set, the imm64 radius 11 vs
16, the HH2C halt site) — each time *after* "enumerate by what the compiler emits, not what
the source says" was already written in this file. Every repeat tonight was a failure of
recognition, not of knowledge. That is why the remedies that worked were **executable**
(`[ -s ]`, the ownership guard, `--error-unmatch`) and the ones that failed were **written**.

## Tools

`freeze_q0_coverage.py` · `freeze_q1_diff.sh` (probes inlined) · `freeze_q2_resolve.py` ·
`freeze_q2_skiptogreen.py`. **Tools, not gates** — the same standing as `audit_gates.py`. None is
wired into `build.sh`; each is run deliberately.

# Freeze-Day Audit II — the run, 2026-08-22

`audit_gates.py` had existed since 2026-08-18 and had **never been run**. Run now.

    assertions parsed : 622
    flagged for review: 258
    by class : A-byte-identity 64 | B-exact-string 151 | C-pattern 118
               D-exit+diag 40 | E-presence 27 | F-threshold 5 | Z-unclassified 217

## Reviewed by hand

**E-presence (26 shown) — mostly false positives.** Spot-checked the two making
the largest claims on a bare `[ -f ]`:
  * `:5467` self-replication — the `[ -f ]` is a PRECONDITION; the real assertion
    is `cmp -s tiny_host "$GEN1"` (byte-identity). Sound.
  * `:3532` autopoiesis successor — `[ -f logos_app ]` is a precondition, then rc
    is checked, then each of generations 0..3 must speak IN ORDER, then the count
    is asserted. Sound.
  The tool is a regex heuristic and says so; presence-as-precondition is its
  main false-positive shape.

**F-threshold (5) — the class that produced this codebase's known defect #3.**
  * `:2942` GC bounded memory — **FALSE POSITIVE, and the interesting one.** The
    tool reads `GRW -lt 150` as an absolute threshold. It is a RATIO IN PERCENT,
    and it is already the REMEDIATION for defect #3: assertion (a) passed clean
    at 16 GiB, so (a') was added comparing peak RSS at 16x the allocation.
    ★ OPEN QUESTION, NOT ANSWERED HERE: `rt_gc`'s √N frontier leak (RSS ∝
    √allocs) has a confirmed root cause and NO commit fixing it. If it were live,
    16x allocation would grow RSS ~400% and this gate would be RED. It is green.
    So either the leak is fixed or **(a') does not discriminate at these sizes**.
    → POST-BUILD: print the ACTUAL `GRW`, not pass/fail. A gate passing at 149%
      is one commit from red and reads identically to one passing at 101%.
  * `:5058` LogosInit sleep — weak but NOT vacuous: it asserts it measured
    (`$SLP` empty on a failed run ⇒ red), and a sleep that never slept gives
    elapsed=0. Real weakness is second granularity and no UPPER bound: a sleep
    of 60 s passes identically to one of 1 s.
  * `:412`, `:2481`, `:2482` — bitwise/bytecode counts; small fixed-size vectors
    where the constant IS the specification. Not rescalable, so not defect #3.

## Not yet reviewed — named rather than silently dropped
**217 Z-unclassified** ("shape not recognised — read by hand") and the remaining
A/B/C/D classes. Densest section is the LA-native assembler at **47 flags** —
also the most recently changed (Track B's nine encoding defects), so highest
prior. That is the next hand-review, not a completed one.

**A clean report is NOT evidence a gate can fail.** The tool's own docstring says
so. Nothing above upgrades a survivor to "verified"; it only removes suspects.

## Task 3 attempt — mutation-testing the standalone gates, and why it does NOT scale

Plan was: perturb each gate's expected value in a copy, confirm RED naming the
real output, confirm the clean copy GREEN. **Measured first, and the plan does
not survive the measurement.**

    46 standalone gates
     2  declare a perturbable expected-value variable  (gate_sha256, gate_crypto)
    44  assert INLINE — `grep -qF "$tok"` over serial output + an exit code

So the mutation lever reaches **2 of 46**, one of which was already mutation-
tested tonight. Reporting that as "the gates are mutation-tested" would be the
exact overclaim this audit exists to catch, so it is not being done.

**What was done instead: hunt the KNOWN shape across all 46 statically.**
Defect #1 in this codebase was an empty marker contained in every output — a
check that passes unconditionally. Scanned all 46 for that shape and its
relatives (`grep -q ""`, comparison against `""`, `-n` used AS the assertion):

    RESULT: no instance found.

★ **That is absence of one shape, not discriminating power.** It says defect #1
has not recurred. It says nothing about whether the 44 inline gates would catch
a real regression, and it must not be quoted as though it did.

**The honest open item.** There is no cheap universal lever for a gate that
boots an image and greps serial tokens: perturbing the token list only proves
grep works, and perturbing the artifact means mutating kernel source. The real
test is whether each gate has ever ACTUALLY gone red — which build logs would
show and git does not retain. Naming this as unresolved rather than closing it.

# Freeze-Day Audit II — finishing the Z pile, 2026-08-26

Erik's sequencing: *finish the audit before starting the archroot arc.* The
outstanding item was **217 (by then 251) Z-unclassified assertions**, recorded as
"shape not recognised — read by hand." Read by hand, that is 251 human judgements.
It turned out not to be 251 gates.

## ★ FINDING 1 — the Z pile was the INSTRUMENT'S SHADOW, not a property of the code

Before reading 251 rows, each was bucketed by what its 6-line window **actually
contained**. The result:

| bucket | count | what it means |
|---|---|---|
| `[ "$a" = "$b" ]` string equality | 128 | **absent from the SHAPES table entirely** |
| `case`/`esac` dispatch | 40 | absent |
| numeric `-eq`/`-ne` | 13 | absent |
| `diff` | 13 | absent |
| assertion sits >6 lines above its FAIL line | 64 | WINDOW too small |
| `cmd \|\| { echo FAIL; }` (must-succeed) | 4 | absent |

**`build.sh`'s single most common assertion idiom — exact string equality — was
not in the tool's table.** The tool was reporting its own blind spot as a property
of the code, and the report read identically to "251 weak gates."

Four shapes were **appended** (never reordered — `classify()` returns the first
match, so appending can only reclassify rows that were already Z). The invariant
was asserted and held exactly: **A=64 B=150 C=121 D=40 E=33 F=5 unchanged**,
total unchanged at 664. Only Z moved.

    Z-unclassified   251  ->  68  (new shapes)
                      68  ->  12  (K-must-succeed + the window measurement)
    flagged           298  ->  65

⚠️ **THIS IS NOT AN UPGRADE OF ANY GATE.** Reclassifying a row from Z to
G-string-eq says the assertion has a strong SHAPE. It does not say the expected
value is right, and it does not say the gate can go red. The pile shrank because
the instrument stopped being blind, not because the code got safer. **Zero of the
251 turned out to be a vacuous gate** — and zero were shown to be sound, either.

**The generalisable form, and it is the one this audit keeps re-learning:** when
an instrument reports a large undifferentiated pile, measure the pile's SHAPE
before working it. The 251 would have cost days of hand-reading to discover the
same four missing regexes. [[an instrument must prove it looked]]

## ★★ FINDING 2 — the NEGATIVE-ASSERTION class, and one PROVEN defect

Bucketing surfaced a class no prior question could see. Q2 asks *which assertions
cannot go RED?* — every one of these CAN. The right question here is different:

> **A negative assertion — `cmd && { echo "FAIL"; }` — passes on ANY non-zero
> exit, including an exit for the WRONG REASON. Unless something pairs with it
> to prove the step ran, "the compiler correctly refused" and "there was no
> compiler" are the same green.**

Nine such gates exist. Five are **sound**: each is paired with a positive
assertion on the same run's output (`681`, `2167`, `2391`, `2394`, `3683`), so a
crashed step reddens the pair. `3683` reasons this out in its own comment.

Four were **unpaired**: `2150`, `2155`, `2622`, `2691` — output sent to
`/dev/null`, only the exit code consulted.

### The proven one: `build.sh:2155`

Its own window deletes the binary it then tests:

    rm -f logos_secd logos_program.bin logos_source.la
    ./tiny_host secd.la    >/dev/null 2>&1     # rc NOT checked
    cp /tmp/mlloud.la logos_source.la
    ./tiny_host codegen.la >/dev/null 2>&1     # rc NOT checked
    ./logos_secd >/dev/null 2>&1 && { echo "FAIL ... did NOT halt on VM"; ok=0; }

Reproduced in shape, four states measured:

| state | old gate |
|---|---|
| A — VM binary never built | **GREEN** |
| B — VM present, correctly halts | GREEN |
| C — VM present, halts SILENTLY (rc=1, no diagnostic) | **GREEN** |
| D — VM present, fails to halt (rc=0) | RED |

**A is indistinguishable from B.** The gate catches 1 of 3 bad states. And
`logos_secd` did not exist in the working tree when this was found — state A was
not hypothetical.

Note this is a **third** shape beside "cannot fail" and "never asked": *a gate
that CAN fail, does fail correctly on the state it was written for, and is
silently green on a different state its own setup can produce.*

### The fix, shown RED before being applied

Assert the **diagnostic**, not merely the exit code — which repairs both the
never-ran hazard and the loudness claim at once (three of the four gates' own
text says "halt LOUDLY" / "no silent wrong binary" while discarding the output
that would prove it).

    MLLV="$(./logos_secd 2>&1)" && { echo "FAIL ... did NOT halt on VM"; ok=0; }
    printf '%s\n' "$MLLV" | grep -q "ill-formed term" || { echo "FAIL ... WITHOUT the loud diagnostic (got: $MLLV)"; ok=0; }

Measured on all four states: **A RED · B GREEN · C RED · D RED** — 3 of 3 bad
states caught, up from 1 of 3. In state A the red names the real reason
(`./logos_secd: not found`), satisfying the standing rule that a red must name
the real output and not a missing binary.

The diagnostics were **witnessed, not assumed**, by running each:

    host  ./tiny_host mlloud.la      -> "metalogic: ill-formed term — excluded middle admits no silent third value; halting"  rc=1
    VM    ./logos_secd               -> the IDENTICAL line                                                                    rc=1
          ./tiny_host native_codegen.la  -> "native_codegen: unsupported binary builtin: lt"                                  rc=1
          ./tiny_host native_codegen2.la -> "native_codegen2: unbound name: chr"                                              rc=1

★ The expected values are patterns encoding the PROPERTY (`unsupported.*\blt\b`),
not the captured line verbatim — so a reworded message does not go red, but a
diagnostic that loses its specificity does. [[expected values: derived, not captured]]

All four patched and re-verified GREEN on the true state (both halves of the
mutation test: red shown first, green confirmed after). All nine negative
assertions now report PAIRED.

## ★ CALIBRATION 3 — this session's new detector produced its own false positives

Recorded because calibrations 1 and 2 are, and because the pattern is now three
for three: **the PAIRED detector certified `2622` and `2691` as sound.** They are
not. It had matched `[ "$ok" -eq 1 ]` — the verdict aggregator that closes *every*
gate block in `build.sh`, which says nothing about any particular assertion. The
aggregator variables are now excluded by name, after which the tool's verdicts
matched the hand analysis on all nine.

**A tool that cries wolf gets ignored; one that cries "sound" is worse.** Every
verdict of a changed classifier must be re-checked — including the ones that
agree with you. [[instruments: match words, not substrings]]

## Remaining, named rather than dropped

* **12 rows still Z**, all FAIL lines inside multi-line `if`/`case` blocks whose
  assertion is the enclosing condition. Structurally sound; not separately verified.
* **65 flagged rows** still need their one human line. Densest: the LA-native
  assembler at 34.
* **`build.sh:3995`** — asserts a structurally incoherent proposition is
  *unconstructible*. That is the exact shape of known vacuous gate #2 (the
  >2-parent node). It is a candidate for the proposed **`[S]` structurally
  enforced** tag rather than `[W]`, and has NOT been checked here.
* **127 G-string-eq rows** are exact-equality gates whose expected value's
  PROVENANCE is unknown — derived, or captured from a run? A captured expectation
  pins current behaviour including current bugs. Not investigated; named.
* The 52-of-78 uninvoked gate scripts (Q0) are **unchanged** by this session.

## The remaining 65 flagged rows — worked, 2026-08-26

All 65 reviewed. Breakdown by flag reason, and what each turned out to be:

| flags | reason | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| 33 | presence-only `[ -f ]` | **zero stand alone** — see below |
| 12 | shape not recognised | FAIL lines inside multi-line `if`/`case`; the assertion is the enclosing condition |
| 9 | negative assertion | 4 fixed above, 5 already PAIRED |
| 7 | marker `'###'` very short | one `grep -q '###'` precondition, attributed to 7 rows by window bleed — **but reading them found a real defect, below** |
| 5 | absolute threshold | reviewed 2026-08-22: 4 false positives + `:5683` weak-but-not-vacuous |
| 3 | computes a value inline | `:48` and `:4500` false positives (arithmetic inside an `echo`; the awk fails safe to RED). `:5683` is the known sleep gate. |

**The 33 presence flags, checked mechanically at BLOCK granularity** (block = between
`say` lines) rather than by the 6-line window: **not one is a standalone presence
claim.** Most are not presence tests at all — they are string-equality assertions
(`[ "$NATIVE_OUT" = "I AM THAT I AM" ]`) that inherited the E-presence label from a
neighbouring `[ -f ]` precondition. The genuine ones (`:1997` `:2533` `:3329` …) sit
in blocks that also assert size, rc, and output on the same artifact.
**BOUND:** "a strong assertion exists in the same block" is weaker than "this
artifact's content is checked." Several were confirmed same-artifact by eye
(`logos_native`: presence + size 171 + output + rc; `logos_secd`: presence + derived
size + `cmp -s`). It was NOT confirmed individually for all 33.

## ★★ FINDING 3 — VACUOUS GATE, PROVEN AND FIXED: the sigil symmetry predicates

Found by reading the 7 low-severity `'###'` rows — i.e. by reading, again, not by
the tool. That is now **five of seven** known vacuous gates found by reading.

`build.sh:4480-4481` define the symmetry predicates as awk over a piped block:

    is_hsym () { awk '{ s=substr($0,2); ... if(r!=s) bad=1 } END { exit bad?1:0 }'; }
    is_vsym () { awk '{ a[NR]=$0 } END { for(i=2;i<=NR;i++) ... exit bad?1:0 }'; }

**On EMPTY input neither loop body runs, `bad` stays unset, and both exit 0 — an
ABSENT sigil reads as SYMMETRIC.** Measured:

    is_hsym < /dev/null            -> rc 0   ("H-symmetric")
    is_vsym < /dev/null            -> rc 0   ("V-symmetric")
    HSYM "g4 SELF" <file lacking that label>  -> rc 0
    => build.sh:4487 GREEN on a sigil that is not there

The helpers themselves are CORRECT on real data (verified separately: rc 0 on a
properly shaped symmetric 32-wide block, rc 1 on an asymmetric one — an earlier
test of mine used 3-char rows, the wrong geometry, and proved nothing; recorded
because a wrong-shaped fixture that "fails" invites a false defect report).

**Why the existing count guard does not catch it:** `[ "$(grep -c '^g[1-9] ' "$2")" = "9" ]`
keys on the PREFIX; `block` keys on the FULL label. Rename a sigil and the count is
still 9 while its block goes empty. Seven gate lines (`:4487-4493`) depend on this.

### ★ The fix is a SEPARATE presence assertion — and fixing the predicate would have BROKEN the gate

The obvious repair — make the helpers return 1 on empty — is **wrong**, and this is
the part worth carrying forward. Line `:4492` asserts `! HSYM && ! VSYM` (BECOMING is
chiral), so under the *broken* helpers it goes **RED** on absence: accidentally
correct. Returning 1 on empty would make both negations TRUE and turn the one line
that survives absence into a vacuous one. **The repair that looks like it fixes six
lines would have broken the seventh.**

Shipped instead: one loop asserting every label's block is non-empty, leaving
`HSYM`/`VSYM` semantics untouched. Red path exercised before shipping:

    label absent, count still 9   -> WITHOUT guard GREEN (the defect) · WITH guard RED
    all labels present            -> WITH guard GREEN (no over-fire)
    line :4492 on absent label    -> RED, unchanged
    the guard against the REAL `./tiny_host sigil.la` output (680 lines,
      all 7 labels present)       -> GREEN

**The class, stated generally:** *a predicate that quantifies over a collection is
vacuously true on the empty collection.* Every `for`/`while` assertion over
grep-derived input carries it, and it is invisible to Q1 (both engines agree — on
nothing) and to Q2 (the gate CAN go red, on non-empty input). It joins the
enumeration as a third question the audit did not know to ask.
