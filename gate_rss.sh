# gate_rss.sh — the rt_gc frontier-drift acceptance test, executable.
#
# Commits the sqrt(allocs) leak as a RED baseline and flips GREEN when the
# allocation-volume GC trigger (GCfix2b) bounds it.  A writes the asm; this
# gate reads only the number heapscope reports -- they meet on that number,
# never on a shared file (the coordination rule).
#
# WHY A PEAK-HEAP GATE AND NOT total RSS: the arena shares one giant PT_LOAD
# with worklist+bitmap, so process RSS conflates them; heapscope's per-region
# pagemap read isolates the heap, which is the region that drifts.  And it
# measures a LIVE process with heapscope's liveness rule, so it can never again
# read a crashing run as a plateau -- the exact failure that voided D's
# retracted conclusions today.
#
# ISOLATION: builds its workload in a private scratch dir (mktemp -d), so it
# touches no tracked file and no /tmp path build.sh hardcodes -- no collision
# with a concurrent A build.  Needs: tiny_host, native_codegen3.la, heapscope.py
# (paths via env or the defaults below).

# ★ THE DEFAULT USED TO BE $HOME/logos, WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY THIS TREE.
# Five worktrees share this script. A gate that measures ~/logos while being
# run from ~/logos-d reports on someone else's binaries and calls it a verdict
# -- and it does so SILENTLY, since ~/logos always exists and always has the
# prerequisites. Default to the directory the script itself lives in, the same
# discipline as build.sh's `cd "$(dirname "$0")"`, so the gate measures the
# tree it was invoked from. An explicit LOGOS= still overrides.
