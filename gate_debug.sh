#!/bin/sh
# gate_debug.sh — the tracing debugger (debug_eval.la), track C.
#
# WHAT IS ACTUALLY AT RISK HERE, and therefore what this gate is about:
# DEBUG_EVAL cannot WRAP EVAL — EVAL's recursion is internal (Z(la self. …)),
# so an outer wrapper observes only the outermost node and nothing beneath it.
# The tracer must BE the self EVAL would have used, so it REPRODUCES EVAL's
# dispatch. A reproduced evaluator can DRIFT from the one it claims to trace,
# and drift is invisible: the trace still looks plausible while describing a
# reduction that never happened.
#
# So the central assertion is NOT "the trace looks right". It is that
# DEBUG_EVAL and EVAL AGREE on the result of every program. Tracing must not
# change the answer. Everything else here is secondary.
#
# SLICE 2 (breakpoints + environment inspection) extends that same assertion
# rather than adding a separate one: every breakpoint program is run through
# the agreement check WITH THE BREAKPOINT ARMED, because a breakpoint reads
# the environment and must not perturb it either. Check 3 then asks the two
# questions agreement cannot: does the breakpoint fire WHERE it should, and
# — the half that is easy to forget — does it fire NOWHERE ELSE. A predicate
# that is accidentally always-true still agrees on every answer.
# (That was "Check 4" until slice 3 inserted a check ahead of it. A stale
# cross-reference in a gate's own header is the cheapest kind of drift and
# the easiest to leave: nothing executes it, so nothing catches it.)
#
# SLICE 3 (the call stack) adds the second projection a breakpoint reports:
# env answers "what is bound here" (LEXICAL — the scope a closure was made
# in), bt answers "how did control get here" (DYNAMIC). Neither is derivable
# from the other, so check 4 asserts they DISAGREE on a program built to
# force them apart, and asserts the ABSENCE of the lexical binder from the
# chain as well as the presence of the call chain — the absence is the only
# half a backtrace secretly rendered from the environment would fail.
#
# SLICE 4 (conditional breakpoints) makes those projections DECIDE rather
# than merely display. Until it, the stack was threaded and printed and
# nothing read it, so a fault in it could only produce a wrong-looking line;
# BRK_CALLER conditions the break ON it, so a fault now changes WHICH nodes
# break. Check 5 runs the unconditioned predicate on the same program as a
# CONTROL and requires the conditional to fire strictly less often — a
# BRK_CALLER degraded to BRK_VAR still fires, still prints a plausible bt,
# and still agrees, so the count relation is the only thing separating them.
#
# SLICE 5 (stepping) adds no dispatch either: a step command is a STOP
# CONDITION, which is how a real debugger implements it — gdb's `next` sets a
# condition on the current FRAME and resumes rather than running a second,
# slower interpreter. So step/step-over/step-out are three more predicates
# over the same (d, ast, env, stk) signature, and check 6 asserts they select
# strictly NESTED stop sets. They measure the STACK, not the depth: `d` counts
# every subexpression while only a call pushes a frame, and on SRC_STEP the
# two numbers differ (7 against 8), so a step-over written on `d` is caught.
#
# SLICE 6 is the DRIVER and the first slice to change the evaluator's SHAPE:
# an ordinal counts nodes already visited, so it flows ACROSS siblings where d
# and stk flow downward, and no predicate can express it. The dispatch threads
# state and returns PAIR(value)(state), the old tracer being DEFINED from it by
# taking FST. Note the cost, which check 7 exists to cover: agreement compares
# the VALUE, so it cannot see a mis-threaded ordinal — measured, not assumed,
# by a red run in which check 1 stayed green with DEBUG_EVAL replaced by EVAL
# outright. The ordinal's oracle is the printed trace: the k-th ENTER line IS
# node k.
#
# SLICE 7 is the POST-MORTEM. Every branch that could not proceed called
# `error` and died with one line — not where, not how control got there, not
# what was bound — so the debugger was useless at exactly the moment you would
# reach for one. It now reports and THEN dies: check 8's load-bearing assertion
# is the NON-ZERO EXIT, because a post-mortem that caught the fault would turn
# a loud failure into a silent one. And "exits non-zero" is true of a harness
# that merely failed to parse, so the run must first be shown to have got far
# enough to fault — that guard is red-tested, not assumed.
