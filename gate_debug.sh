# gate_debug.sh — the tracing debugger (debug_eval.la), track C.
#
# WHAT IS ACTUALLY AT RISK HERE, and therefore what this gate is about:
# DEBUG_EVAL cannot WRAP EVAL — EVAL's recursion is internal (Z(la self. …)),
# so an outer wrapper observes only the outermost node and nothing beneath it.
# The tracer must BE the self EVAL would have used, so it REPRODUCES EVAL's
# dispatch. A reproduced evaluator can DRIFT from the one it claims to trace,
# and drift is invisible: the trace still looks plausible while describing a
# reduction that never happened.
#
# So the central assertion is NOT "the trace looks right". It is that
# DEBUG_EVAL and EVAL AGREE on the result of every program. Tracing must not
# change the answer. Everything else here is secondary.
#
# SLICE 2 (breakpoints + environment inspection) extends that same assertion
# rather than adding a separate one: every breakpoint program is run through
# the agreement check WITH THE BREAKPOINT ARMED, because a breakpoint reads
# the environment and must not perturb it either. Check 4 then asks the two
# questions agreement cannot: does the breakpoint fire WHERE it should, and
# — the half that is easy to forget — does it fire NOWHERE ELSE. A predicate
# that is accidentally always-true still agrees on every answer.
