# LA CLAIM INDEX — the 38 unbuilt items mapped to the paper's Ledger

Built 2026-09-05. **This file IS `LA_COMPLETION.md:770`**, which reads
`[ ] Every Tier-1/2 item above needs its paper counterpart at the right tag`.

## Why it was needed

`LA_COMPLETION.md` opens by claiming: *"Every item carries the gate that would
prove it, and its white-paper counterpart."* Measured: **2 of 38 unbuilt items
carry a `*Paper:*` reference** (4 occurrences of `Paper:` in the whole file).
The header was an unwitnessed claim, and it is the reason no one could say which
items serve which claims — or which would be closed by correcting a claim rather
than by writing code.

## The key, and why it can be trusted

Source: `~/Downloads/LA White Paper.pdf` (newest, 67,588 words). The Ledger is
**56 rows** across two tables. `pdftotext` splits it into three separate column
blocks, so component↔tag pairing is POSITIONAL and could silently mis-align —
the exact hazard that would make this whole index wrong.

**Pairing validated against seven independently known answers before use:**

| Ledger row | tag + bound | independently known to be |
|---|---|---|
| Bitwise operations | `[W]` six ops, byte-identical, five engines | landed `36325fc`; I re-verified the five-engine property today |
| Constant-time execution | `[A]` not held; three properties by discipline | build queue 4.2, verbatim |
| Phonetic injectivity at scale | `[A]` synthesis gated; collision test absent | build queue 0.1, verbatim |
| Privacy layer | `[B]` writable; no entropy source, no signatures | Tier 5 items 32 + 33 |
| Module reachability | `[B]` | `LA_COMPLETION.md:481` already cites *§Limitations, [B]* |
| Nine ungated modules | `[B]` | cited at `LA_COMPLETION.md:487` |
| Implicature | `[B]` | build queue 5.1 cites *Ledger row Implicature [B]* |

Counts also agree: 35 components ↔ 35 tags in table 1, 21 ↔ 21 in table 2.
Tag census over the whole paper: **[A] 74, [B] 253, [W] 192, [S] 0**; control
`[Q]` = 0, so the tag scan can report absence.

## Confidence column

`EXACT` — the paper's own text or an existing citation names this pairing.
`INFERRED` — I matched by concept; a reader should check before relying on it.

## WHAT THE INDEX FOUND

**1. The overclaim track is near-empty.** Of the four claims reported as
overclaims, `lossless` is already bounded in its own sentence (*"Lossless over
meaning; lossy over spelling, by design [B]"*, plus *"invariant-preserving, not
lossless"* twice); `Perfect Communication` and `Completeness Commitment` appear
in NEITHER paper, and the paper explicitly disclaims the strong reading
(*"The claim is not that ambiguity is impossible in principle"*); `dolphin` has
one hit, about Khoisan clicks being producible by dolphins, not a speaker claim.
**No unbuilt item is closed by correcting any of the four.**

**2. Eight items CHALLENGE a `[W]`, they do not close an `[A]`** — #4, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 14, and the #36 contradiction. This is the opposite of backlog: a `[W]`
is a claim the paper says is *witnessed*, and these say the witness is
incomplete. ★ **They should be triaged before any `[A]` work**, because an
overstated `[W]` is worse than an open `[A]` — the same ruling this project
already made about gates that cannot go red.

**3. Four items have NO paper counterpart at all** — #13, 28, 30, 35. Each is
either work the paper never licensed, or a genuine paper gap. #13 is the
sharpest: **phonetic injectivity has a Ledger row and an `[A]`; visual
injectivity has neither**, though the trimodal claim asserts the registers are
identical.

**4. Only 6 of 56 Ledger rows are `[A]`** — Self-invocation, Constant-time,
Phonetic injectivity, Meta-autontopoiesis, Census verifiable, E_S in the
lexicon. The other 68 `[A]` tags in the paper are inline, not Ledger rows, so
the Ledger is NOT a complete claim index and should not be treated as one.

## HOW TO KEEP THIS TRUE

The failure this file exists to fix is a header claiming a property nothing
checked. So: **every `[ ]` item in `LA_COMPLETION.md` must appear in the table
above.** That is mechanically checkable, and until a gate checks it, this file
carries the same defect it was written to correct.
