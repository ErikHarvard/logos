# gate_link_hiaddr.sh — the 32-BIT WINDOW is enforced, not merely declared.
#
# ★ WHAT THIS EXISTS TO CATCH. link.la reads the LOW 4 bytes of each 8-byte
#   ELF64 field. Its header has always said the high word is "checked where it
#   costs nothing so the failure is loud rather than silent." It was NOT:
#   SYM_VHIGH was defined AND exported and called by NOTHING, and the STAB
#   record captured ST_VHI without ever looking at it. A symbol at or above
#   4 GB had its high word DISCARDED and linked to its low word.
#
# ★★ AND IT DEFEATED THE GUARD THAT DID EXIST. link_reloc.la's FITS32 refuses a
#   value too large to write into a 4-byte field — but a truncated READ yields a
#   SMALL number (0x1_0000_0000 reads as 0), which FITS32 then accepts. Guarding
#   the write is worthless while the read silently truncates; both directions
#   are needed to close one limit.
#
# ★★★ MEASURED RED PATH, not asserted. Against the PRE-GUARD linker this exact
#   fixture exits 0 and prints "resolved greet -> 4198416" — a symbol genuinely
#   at 0x100000000 linked to 0x401010. Plausible, wrong, and green. That is the
#   failure this gate converts into a loud refusal.
#
# Latent today (this layout sits near 0x401000, kernel.ld at 0x100000) and
# reachable the moment anything links high — a higher-half kernel at
# 0xffffffff80000000 is the obvious case.
#
# No `set -e`: this gate's assertions READ the output of commands that are
# EXPECTED to exit non-zero, and `set -e` would abort before the FAIL line ever
# printed. Statuses are checked explicitly instead.
