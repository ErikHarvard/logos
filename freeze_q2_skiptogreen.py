"""q2_skiptogreen — a non-vacuity guard that EXITS GREEN when nothing was tested.

★ SIGNATURE DERIVED FROM A VERIFIED INSTANCE, not guessed. Two earlier cuts of
this tool were wrong and the positive control caught both:
  cut 1  flagged 39/43 on "no non-vacuity guard" — meaningless, since gate_k4a.sh's
         assertions are UNCONDITIONAL and need no guard.
  cut 2  assumed the defect was a MISSING counter. The pre-fix gate_hal_idle.sh has
         `found=0 / found=1` — the counter was there all along.

The actual defect (kernel/gate_hal_idle.sh, fixed by Track D in 22dfd8c):

    found=0
    for ... ; do  [ -f "$elf" ] || continue ;  found=1 ; ... done
    if [ "$found" -eq 0 ]; then echo "SKIP ..."; exit 0; fi      <-- GREEN on nothing

The guard fires correctly and then does nothing. Track D's fix changed one token,
exit 0 -> exit 1, with the comment "Testing nothing is not passing."

So the question is not "is there a guard" but "does the guard have TEETH":
    G  a zero-case check whose branch exits 0 instead of 1

This is the vacuous-gate pattern one level up — an assertion that CAN fire, fires,
and is then discarded. Still a SHAPE: a gate that legitimately reports SKIP when
hardware is absent is correct. The defect is exiting 0 while KNOWING it tested
nothing, because the caller cannot distinguish that from success.
