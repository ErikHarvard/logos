;  LogOS kernel — K1 boot stub (bare metal, no host OS)
;
;  The bridge from GRUB/QEMU-multiboot (which hands off in 32-bit
;  protected mode, paging OFF) to the 64-bit Lingua-Adamica kernel image
;  that native_codegen3 already emits.
;
;  It does the irreducible "physics" only:
;    (1) Multiboot1 header so a multiboot loader will load us.
;    (2) 32-bit entry -> build identity page tables -> enable long mode.
;    (3) 64-bit: set up the SYSCALL substrate (EFER.SCE + STAR/LSTAR)
;        so the LA image's own `syscall` instructions (write, exit) are
;        serviced by THIS kernel — write(1,...)->COM1 serial,
;        exit(n)->isa-debug-exit + halt. So the SAME LA binary that runs
;        under Linux runs here UNMODIFIED. The real identity is here: the
;        incbin'd image IS byte-for-byte the host binary — one being on two
;        substrates (host_image ≡ metal_image, ⊕(SELF,SELF), the eighth
;        self-relation). The syscall SERVICE, by contrast, earns only b_τ = f_τ
;        over the write+exit subset the image uses (fd ignored, exit code
;        discarded, unknown syscalls return 0) — a YIELDS-equivalence, NOT a
;        blanket ≡. (WITH_OK in build.sh witnesses both — see gate_with_ok.sh.)
;    (4) init COM1, then jump into the LA image entry (its `prol`).
;
;  LA_ENTRY (the prol vaddr) is generated per-build from the ELF's
;  e_entry by build_k1.sh into entry.inc. The LA image itself is placed
;  at 0x400000 by kernel.ld (incbin of native_codegen3_out).
;
;  K1 has NO IDT yet: a CPU fault triple-faults (QEMU -no-reboot makes
;  the gate fail loudly). K2 adds the IDT + loud fault handlers.

; K3b: the LA image's stack top. The native_codegen3 runtime arms a soft stack
; guard at STACK_LIMIT = STACK_BASE - 7 MiB (STACK_BASE = the rsp it starts
; with), sized for the Linux 8 MiB stack. On the metal we must give it an
; equally-tall stack whose base is > 7 MiB, or that subtraction underflows and
; the guard misfires immediately. 0x8000000 (128 MiB) is identity-mapped RAM
; above the LA image (4 MiB), its GC worklist (~4-68 MiB) and heap use, giving
; a full 7 MiB stack with no underflow. (Requires QEMU -m >= 160 or so; the
; gates use 256 — gate_hal4e.sh uses 512.) The 32-bit trampoline still uses the
; small boot_stack.
;

;   worklist base 0x410be0 (4.06 MiB) | heap base r15 0x4410be0 (68.0 MiB)
;   HEAP_END      0x404410be0 (16.07 GiB!) | STACK_LIMIT 0x7900000 (121 MiB)
;
; The stack guard is ONE-DIRECTIONAL. `cmp rsp,[STACK_LIMIT]` stops the STACK
; growing DOWN into the heap. NOTHING stops the HEAP growing UP into the stack:
; alloc24's only bound is `cmp rcx,[HEAP_END]`, and PROL sets HEAP_END to
; hb + HEAP_SIZE where HEAP_SIZE is 16 GiB — sized for Linux, where it is lazily
; mapped address space. On the metal that bound sits ~300x beyond the top of a
; 512 MiB machine, so it is UNREACHABLE and cannot fire.
;
; Concretely, as the heap bumps up from 68 MiB it will:
;   at 121 MiB (STACK_LIMIT) start overwriting the LA stack — SILENTLY;
;   at 128 MiB pass the stack top;
;   at 512 MiB leave physical RAM entirely;
; and `native: heap exhausted` is never reached in any of those cases. The
; failure mode is a clobbered return address -> control transfers into stack
; bytes -> whatever they decode to.
;
; ── THIS IS NOT LATENT. IT FIRES IN UNDER 90 SECONDS. (corrected 2026-07-18) ──
; An earlier version of this comment said "~53 MiB of real headroom, so this is
; latent, not immediate — HAL.4e never got near it". BOTH CLAUSES WERE WRONG.
; Measured: every HAL.4x ELF, booted and left ALONE with ZERO keystrokes, dies
; in ABOUT SIX SECONDS — comp_text with #PF at rip=0x04454db8 (which is 346 KB
; INTO THE HEAP, i.e. a return address overwritten by a heap pointer), comp_term
; and comp_edit with #UD a few hundred bytes below LA_STACK_TOP.
;
; SIX SECONDS EXPLAINS EVERY SYMPTOM THIS TRACK CHASED. The interactive gates
; pass only because they FINISH FIRST: HAL.4e sends 3 keys (~2 s) and HAL.4f
; sends 5 (~3.5 s), both under the wire; HAL.4g sends 11 (~6.6 s) and dies just
; short of its ENTER. Adding a screendump to 4e's gate cost ~1 s and pushed it
; over — which is the "RED" that was originally blamed on the instrument.
; Slowing 4g's keys to 2 s each killed it at the third character. One fact, and
; it had been wearing four different disguises.
;
; Two mistakes fed that wrong "latent":
;   1. I reasoned a rising heap must hit the BOTTOM of the stack region (121
;      MiB) first, and dismissed the collision because the faulting rip was at
;      the TOP. But the runtime does TCO, so these loops run at CONSTANT SHALLOW
;      DEPTH: the live frames are the top few HUNDRED BYTES, and 121 MiB up to
;      them is unused. A rising heap crosses all of it harmlessly and destroys
;      the live frames AT THE TOP. The "counter-evidence" was the signature.
;   2. The headroom is crossed in about a minute because `POLL` BOXES AN INT PER
;      SPIN ITERATION (`inb` returns a boxed INT), so an idle compositor
;      allocates hard. That is also why stalling the guest (a screendump) or
;      slowing the keystrokes always made the crash come SOONER, which had
;      looked like two unrelated mysteries.
;
; So HAL.4e/4f/4g are TIME-BOUNDED, not correct: their gates run ~20 s and pass
; honestly, but nothing in the suite runs long enough to witness this.
;
; The FIX belongs in rt_init, not here: it already discriminates metal from
; Linux (METAL_FLAG / CPL) and already computes STACK_LIMIT, so it is the one
; place that can clamp HEAP_END to STACK_LIMIT on the metal path and turn a
; silent overrun into the loud halt the discipline requires. That file is
; native_codegen3_rt.asm — TRACK A's, not this track's — so this comment states
; the hazard where a kernel reader will hit it, and the request is on the board.
; Do not "fix" it here by shrinking the stack; that hides it without closing it.

; single high PDPT pointing PDPT[510] at the existing low-1-GiB PD aliases every
; low physical page P at 0xFFFFFFFF80000000+P. A high address is reachable by a
; sign-extended disp32 (0x80000000 → 0xFFFFFFFF80000000), so once the LA image is

;  p1_sched — THE SCHEDULER OVER THE PROCESS TABLE.
;
;  Runs in the high half on the high kernel stack, which every process shares via
;  PML4[511], so it stays mapped across every CR3 switch. It scans the PCB array
;  for a RUNNABLE entry, loads that PCB's CR3, and enters the process at ring 3
;  with ITS entry and ITS stack. When no runnable entry remains, the run is over:
;  say so and exit 33.
;
;  This is what replaces HH2c's `hh2c_stage` byte. Note what is NOT in this loop:
;  the number of processes. It walks the table, so a third process costs exactly
;  what the second costs — which is the property a hardcoded stage byte does not
;  have, and the reason gate_p1.sh asserts three.
