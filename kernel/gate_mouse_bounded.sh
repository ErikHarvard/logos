# gate_mouse_bounded.sh — Freeze Audit II / Q3: the mouse driver's OWED waits are
# bounded, so a controller that never answers is DIAGNOSED instead of killing the
# kernel.
#
# ── THE ADJUDICATION THIS GATE ENCODES ──────────────────────────────────────
#   waiting for a USER            -> correctly unbounded (packet byte 0)
#   waiting for a response OWED   -> must be bounded (IBF handshake, 0xFA ACK,
#      by the device                packet bytes 1-2)
# Bounding byte 0 as well would make an idle user look like a broken device, so
# it is deliberately left alone and this gate does not test it.
#
# ── WHY A SELF-INFLICTED FAULT IS LEGITIMATE HERE ───────────────────────────
# A BOUND claims only "this loop terminates". Any never-satisfied condition
# tests that, so removing the command whose ACK we then wait for is a fair red
# path. A REPAIR would claim the DEVICE was fixed, which needs a fault that is
# realistic AND persistent -- the standard HAL.3d failed twice (see
# SELFREPAIR_3d_DESIGN.md). Do not read this gate as proving fault-tolerance.
#
# Three kernels, one fault:
#   kernel_mouse.elf          healthy device      -> must still work (gate_mouse.sh)
#   kernel_mouse_faulted.elf  fault + bounded     -> must DIAGNOSE, exit cleanly
#   kernel_mouse_ctrl.elf     fault + UNBOUNDED   -> must DIE (the pre-fix driver)
