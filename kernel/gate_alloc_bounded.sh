# LogOS allocation-boundedness gate — DOES MEMORY SCALE WITH WORK WHEN NOTHING
# IS LIVE? It must not. Today it does, so this gate is RED on purpose.
#
# ── THE CRITERION ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# kernel/alloc_churn.la is a tail-recursive countdown. `sub(n)(1)` and
# `int_eq(n)(0)` each box an int and every box is dead immediately, so AT ANY
# INSTANT THE LIVE SET IS ONE INTEGER. The recursion is in tail position and the
# runtime does TCO, so the stack does not grow. Peak RSS must therefore be FLAT
# in the iteration count.
#
# The test TRIPLES the work and requires memory not to follow. Measured today:
#     N=1,000       0.75 MB   <- baseline: startup costs essentially nothing
#     N=5,000,000     170 MB
#     N=15,000,000    300 MB
#     N=45,000,000    519 MB
#     N=135,000,000   905 MB
# ~1.74x memory per 3x work. The GC reclaims SOMETHING (the 135M run allocates
# ~3.2 GB of boxes yet peaks at 905 MB) but never plateaus.
#
# ── WHY A RATIO AND NOT A BYTE BUDGET ───────────────────────────────────────
# An absolute bar ("must stay under 32 MB") would encode MY guess about what a
# repaired collector ought to use, and would then be a check on my guess rather
# than on the system. The ratio tests the PROPERTY the program actually claims:
# memory does not scale with work. It also cannot be satisfied by a collector
# that is merely tuned to a smaller constant — only by one that stops growing.
# Baseline is reported alongside so a reader can see the absolute cost too.
#
# ── WHY THIS GATE EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# It is the companion to kernel/gate_hal_idle.sh. That one shows the SYMPTOM on
# bare metal (every HAL.4x compositor dies in ~6 s when the heap overruns the LA
# stack at 128 MiB); this one shows the CAUSE on Linux in seconds, with no QEMU
# and no kernel build. Whoever repairs the allocator/collector
# (native_codegen3_rt.asm — track A) can run this to see the fix land, and it
# turns green the moment memory stops scaling.
#
# Usage: kernel/gate_alloc_bounded.sh [N]     (default 5000000; also runs 3N)
