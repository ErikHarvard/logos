# gate_hal3c.sh — HAL.3c: the ATA wait is BOUNDED, so a disk that never becomes
# ready is DIAGNOSED instead of killing the kernel.
#
# ── THE BUG THIS GATE EXISTS FOR (found + reproduced 2026-08-18) ────────────
# ata.la's WAITDRQ had no fuel. On a channel that never becomes ready it
# recursed until it ran off into unmapped memory:
#     ata:|EXCEPTION 0d err=0000000000000000 rip=0000000007ffffc0
# Deterministic, and identical with a present-but-empty CD-ROM — two real fault
# modes, one silent crash with nothing naming the disk as the cause.
#
# ★ WHY NO GATE SAW IT: every ATA gate attaches a working disk. HAL.3 and HAL.3b
# are both [x] DONE + gated and both were RIGHT — they simply never presented
# the fault. A driver is not proven robust by a gate that only ever gives it a
# healthy device. That is the same blind spot HAL.5q/5r were built to close on
# the NIC, applied to the disk organ.
#
# ── THREE CHECKS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   1. HEALTHY PATH UNCHANGED — with a real disk the driver still reads the
#      sector. The bound must not cost the working case.
#   2. FAULT DIAGNOSED — with no disk it prints "ata drq timeout st=<status>"
#      and "ata dead", and exits CLEANLY. No EXCEPTION.
#   3. RED PATH — the unbounded control (kernel/ata_ctrl.la, the driver exactly
#      as it was before) must still CRASH on the same input. Without this the
#      gate cannot tell you the bound did anything.
