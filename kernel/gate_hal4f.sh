# LogOS HAL.4f gate — a TYPEWRITER on the metal (typing, not just displaying).
# Boot the metal terminal, inject KEYSTROKES through the QEMU monitor, and assert
# from BOTH the serial line and an independent screendump that the typed
# characters were accumulated into a buffer and rastered as real glyphs:
#   - "term ready"           — the compositor armed (mode set, empty buffer +
#                              cursor presented);
#   - "term buf=L"           — the FIRST keystroke decoded and appended;
#   - "term buf=LOGOS"       — all five accumulated IN ORDER. This is the
#                              load-bearing assertion: a decode that dropped a
#                              key, doubled one (release codes not rejected), or
#                              reversed the append would produce a DIFFERENT
#                              string here and fail, while still "printing
#                              something" — which is why the gate matches the
#                              exact buffer, not merely a "term buf=" prefix;
#   - "term on=255,255,255"  — probe (201,141) is 'L' row 0 col 0: a WHITE
#                              stroke, so the font really rastered the typed char;
#   - "term off=0,255,0"     — probe (222,141) is 'L' row 0 col 7: window B's
#                              GREEN showing through INSIDE the same text cell,
#                              so what drew is a GLYPH SHAPE, not a filled block.
#                              Either probe alone is passable by a broken
#                              renderer (a dead draw leaves both green; a runaway
#                              fill leaves both white) — the PAIR is what pins it;
#   - "term done"            — ENTER ended the loop;
#   - exit 33                — MAIN returned -> exit(0) -> isa-debug-exit.

# ── TWO BOOTS, ON PURPOSE. Do not fold them back into one. ──────────────────
# HAL.4e's gate did both jobs in one boot — screendump the frame, THEN send the
# keys — and spent a day reporting its own perturbation as the subject's defect
# (measured: with a pre-key screendump 'text done' never appeared, 0/3; without
# it, 3/3; sleeping LONGER made it worse, so it is not a transient to wait out).
# See kernel/gate_hal4e.sh and commit da93d81. HAL.4f is built with that lesson
# from the start: boot 1 runs the interactive assertion with NO screendump
# touching it, and boot 2 does the capture in its own process. The mechanism was
# never pinned, which is exactly why the two measurements stay separated.
#
# Boots the ALREADY-BUILT ELF and never rebuilds: comp_term.la's native_codegen3
# compile is very slow (superlinear codegen), so the ELF is an out-of-band
# artifact built by kernel/build_hal4f.sh, exactly like the heavy K6/K7 kernels.
# Skips (rc 0) if QEMU is absent.

# ── ★ FRESH-CHECKOUT FIX, 2026-09-08 — THIS GATE COULD PASS HAVING TESTED NOTHING
# It printed SKIP and `exit 0` when kernel/kernel_comp_term.elf was missing. That ELF is an
# UNTRACKED build artifact (.gitignore: /kernel/kernel_*.elf), so on a fresh clone,
# or after `git clean`, this gate asserted NOTHING and said so with a success code.
# Wiring it in that state would have ADDED A FALSE GREEN to build.sh — worse than
# leaving it unwired, which is why the gate census ruled "fix the skip first".
#
# This is kernel/gate_hal_idle.sh's fix (2026-08-19) applied to the same defect:
#   ★ "I tested nothing" MUST NOT BE SPELLED THE SAME WAY AS "everything passed".
#
# WHY THE BUILD IS OPT-IN RATHER THAN AUTOMATIC, and this is measured, not assumed:
# comp_term.la costs 38m01s and 41m24s, measured on two runs (build_hal4f.sh:11).
# gate_hal_idle.sh auto-builds only its 41-SECOND control and records that
# auto-building THESE kernels "was rejected on cost". An unconditional build here
# would silently turn any suite that wires this gate into a multi-hour run.
# So: build on explicit opt-in, and otherwise FAIL LOUDLY. Note this is the
# opposite of the skip flag build.sh forbids — there is no way to make this gate
# report success without actually running the kernel.
