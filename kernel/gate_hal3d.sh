# gate_hal3d.sh — HAL.3d: a SELF-REPAIRING ATA read path.
#
# AATC's Sense -> Diagnose -> Prescribe -> Retry applied to the DISK organ, as
# HAL.5q/5r applied it to the NIC. HAL.3c bounded the wait and NAMED the
# failure; it stops. This one recovers: on a wedged channel it senses status
# and the error register, diagnoses, applies the drive's OWN documented
# software reset (SRST in device control 0x3F6), re-issues the read, and either
# recovers or says "ata dead" — bounded at every step.
#
# ── ★ CHECK 1 IS LOAD-BEARING. READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING A GREEN ────────────
# The fault is SELF-INFLICTED: the driver holds the drive in reset so its first
# read cannot complete. If QEMU ignores that register write, the drive never
# wedges, the repair branch is DEAD CODE, and every other check here passes
# while proving nothing whatsoever.
#
# This is not hypothetical. HAL.5s died on exactly this: a real TABT fault
# turned out to be inert in QEMU (it raises TOK+TUN and never TABT), and 5s is
# HELD as a result. So check 1 asserts the wedge ACTUALLY HAPPENED, and the
# driver prints "ata read ok (NO WEDGE — fault did not manifest)" if it did not,
# so the failure names itself instead of hiding as a pass.
