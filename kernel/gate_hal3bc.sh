# gate_hal3bc.sh — HAL.3bc: the ATA WRITE path's waits are BOUNDED, so a channel
# that never becomes ready is diagnosed BY STAGE instead of killing the kernel.
#
# The write twin of gate_hal3c.sh. ata3b.la had THREE unbounded waits where the
# read path had one — DRQ before pushing the sector, BSY after the cache flush,
# DRQ again on the read-back — so a wedged channel had three ways to die with
# nothing on serial naming the disk. The flush wait is the worst of them: it
# sits AFTER 512 bytes have already been pushed, which is exactly where giving
# up without a word costs most.
#
# ★ WHY THE STAGE IS NAMED, not just the timeout: "which of the three waits gave
# up" is the difference between a drive that never accepted the write and one
# that never flushed it. A bare "timeout" would collapse those into one symptom.
#
# Same three checks as HAL.3c: healthy path unchanged / fault diagnosed /
# red-path against the unbounded original, which must still crash.
