# LogOS HAL.4e gate — a MOVABLE TEXT WINDOW on the metal (the terminal foundation).
# Boot the metal text-compositor, capture the screen, inject keystrokes through the
# QEMU monitor, and assert from BOTH the serial line and an independent screendump
# that real glyphs were rastered into a window that then MOVED with them:
#   - "text ready"          — the compositor armed (mode set, initial frame shown);
#   - "text on=255,255,255" — probe (201,141) is 'L' row 0 col 0: a WHITE stroke,
#                             so the font really rastered;
#   - "text off=0,255,0"    — probe (222,141) is 'L' row 0 col 7: window B's GREEN
#                             showing through INSIDE the same text cell, so what
#                             drew is a GLYPH SHAPE, not a filled block. Either
#                             probe alone is passable by a broken renderer (a dead
#                             draw leaves both green; a runaway fill leaves both
#                             white) — the PAIR is what pins it;
#   - "text bx=300"         — after 3x 'd' (right, +40 each: 180->220->260->300);
#   - "text on=0,0,255"     — the window AND its text have moved off the probe, so
#                             the pixel there is now window A's RED showing through:
#                             a genuine re-compose + re-present of a NEW frame;
#   - "text done"           — ENTER ended the loop;
#   - exit 33               — MAIN returned -> exit(0) -> isa-debug-exit.
# The screendump is the INDEPENDENT witness (serial peeks the LFB; the screendump
# is what QEMU actually scans out): the initial text bounding box must hold both
# white glyph pixels AND green window pixels — text on a window, not a white bar.
#
# Boots the ALREADY-BUILT ELF and never rebuilds: comp_text.la's native_codegen3

# ── ★ FRESH-CHECKOUT FIX, 2026-09-08 — THIS GATE COULD PASS HAVING TESTED NOTHING
# It printed SKIP and `exit 0` when kernel/kernel_comp_text.elf was missing. That ELF is an
# UNTRACKED build artifact (.gitignore: /kernel/kernel_*.elf), so on a fresh clone,
# or after `git clean`, this gate asserted NOTHING and said so with a success code.
# Wiring it in that state would have ADDED A FALSE GREEN to build.sh — worse than
# leaving it unwired, which is why the gate census ruled "fix the skip first".
#
# This is kernel/gate_hal_idle.sh's fix (2026-08-19) applied to the same defect:
#   ★ "I tested nothing" MUST NOT BE SPELLED THE SAME WAY AS "everything passed".
#
# WHY THE BUILD IS OPT-IN RATHER THAN AUTOMATIC, and this is measured, not assumed:
# comp_text.la costs ~15 min+ (superlinear codegen; larger than comp_session.la at ~13 min).
# gate_hal_idle.sh auto-builds only its 41-SECOND control and records that
# auto-building THESE kernels "was rejected on cost". An unconditional build here
# would silently turn any suite that wires this gate into a multi-hour run.
# So: build on explicit opt-in, and otherwise FAIL LOUDLY. Note this is the
# opposite of the skip flag build.sh forbids — there is no way to make this gate
# report success without actually running the kernel.

# ── TWO BOOTS, ON PURPOSE. Do not fold them back into one. ──────────────────
# This gate used to do both jobs in a single boot: screendump the initial frame,
# THEN send the keys. That made the gate report its own perturbation as the
# subject's defect. Measured 2026-07-18, 3 trials each, identical boot and
# identical keystrokes, the ONLY difference being the screendump:
#     no screendump  -> 'text done' 3/3, exit 33 3/3   (HAL.4e passes)
#     pre-key dump   -> 'text done' 0/3, exit 35/33/35 (the recorded RED)
#     post-key dump  -> 'text done' 1/1, exit 33
# So HAL.4e was GREEN the whole time; the instrument was standing in the
# subject's way. Note also that the exit code was FLAKY under the screendump
# (35/33/35) while the missing 'text done' was deterministic — reading the
# failure off `exit != 33` was reading it off the noisier signal.
# Sleeping LONGER after the screendump does not help; it gets WORSE (with
# sleep 3.0 the run never even reached bx=300), so this is not a transient the
# harness can wait out. The mechanism is NOT pinned — see the board — which is
# itself the reason to keep the measurements separated rather than interleaved.
#
# Boot 1: the interactive assertion, with NO screendump touching it.
