# LogOS HAL.4g gate — an EDITABLE, SCROLLING LINE on the metal.
# HAL.4f could type but not un-type, and silently DISCARDED input past 7 chars.
# This gate proves both of those are gone, by typing a line, DELETING from it,
# and then overflowing it:
#   - "edit ready"            — armed (mode set, empty line + cursor presented);
#   - "edit buf=LOGOS"        — five keystrokes accumulated in order;
#   - "edit buf=LOGO"         — BACKSPACE removed the last character. This is an
#                               EXACT-LINE match (grep -x), and it has to be:
#                               "edit buf=LOGO" is a SUBSTRING of the earlier
#                               "edit buf=LOGOS" line, so a substring match would
#                               pass WITHOUT backspace ever working;
#   - "edit buf=LOGOSABCD"    — the buffer grew to NINE characters, past MAXCH=7.
#                               Under HAL.4f those last two keys were discarded;
#   - "edit view=GOSABCD"     — and what is ON SCREEN is the LAST SEVEN of them.
#                               This is the scrolling assertion: buf and view
#                               have DIVERGED. A build that ignored overflow
#                               would show view==LOGOSAB (the first seven) or
#                               refuse the keys entirely;
#   - "edit on=255,255,255"   — probe (201,141) white: a real glyph stroke;
#   - "edit off=0,255,0"      — probe (222,141) green: window B through the SAME
#                               cell, so it is a GLYPH SHAPE not a filled block.
#                               (Both probes are substring matches: they need to
#                               hold on the frames where the first cell is 'L',
#                               not on every frame — once the view scrolls, cell
#                               0 is 'G', whose row 0 leaves column 0 CLEAR.);
#   - "edit done"             — ENTER ended the loop;
#   - exit 33                 — MAIN returned -> exit(0) -> isa-debug-exit.
#
# ── TWO BOOTS, ON PURPOSE. Do not fold them back into one. ──────────────────
# HAL.4e's gate did both jobs in one boot — screendump, THEN keys — and spent a
# day reporting its own perturbation as the subject's defect (measured: with a
# pre-key screendump the loop never finished, 0/3; without it, 3/3; sleeping
# LONGER made it worse). See kernel/gate_hal4e.sh and commit da93d81. Boot 1
# here runs the interactive assertion with NO screendump touching it; boot 2
# does the capture in its own process and quits without ENTER, so if the capture
# perturbs what follows it cannot reach a verdict.
#
# Boots the ALREADY-BUILT ELF and never rebuilds: comp_edit.la's compile is
# ~40 minutes (MEASURED on HAL.4f: 38m01s and 41m24s), so the ELF is an
# out-of-band artifact built by kernel/build_hal4g.sh.
# Skips (rc 0) if QEMU is absent.

# ── ★ FRESH-CHECKOUT FIX, 2026-09-08 — THIS GATE COULD PASS HAVING TESTED NOTHING
# It printed SKIP and `exit 0` when kernel/kernel_comp_edit.elf was missing. That ELF is an
# UNTRACKED build artifact (.gitignore: /kernel/kernel_*.elf), so on a fresh clone,
# or after `git clean`, this gate asserted NOTHING and said so with a success code.
# Wiring it in that state would have ADDED A FALSE GREEN to build.sh — worse than
# leaving it unwired, which is why the gate census ruled "fix the skip first".
#
# This is kernel/gate_hal_idle.sh's fix (2026-08-19) applied to the same defect:
#   ★ "I tested nothing" MUST NOT BE SPELLED THE SAME WAY AS "everything passed".
#
# WHY THE BUILD IS OPT-IN RATHER THAN AUTOMATIC, and this is measured, not assumed:
# comp_edit.la costs ~49 min (gate_hal_idle.sh:78).
# gate_hal_idle.sh auto-builds only its 41-SECOND control and records that
# auto-building THESE kernels "was rejected on cost". An unconditional build here
# would silently turn any suite that wires this gate into a multi-hour run.
# So: build on explicit opt-in, and otherwise FAIL LOUDLY. Note this is the
# opposite of the skip flag build.sh forbids — there is no way to make this gate
# report success without actually running the kernel.
