# LogOS kernel K5b.1b slice gate — a suspended task's heap roots survive a GC.
# Compile task_gc.la and run it LINUX-HOSTED (no QEMU). Task A holds a canary
# heap string live across a yield; task B then churns ~320 MB of garbage, which
# with the K5b.1c PERIODIC GC (fires every 64 MB, not only at 16 GiB exhaustion)
# triggers several REAL collections WHILE A is suspended. When A resumes it
# checks the canary byte-for-byte:
#   - "SURVIVED"  => rt_gc's K5b.1b per-task root scan marked A's suspended
#                    regs + stack, so the canary was NOT swept (the whole point).
#   - "CORRUPTED" (or a crash) => the canary was collected/reused -> the fix is
#                    absent or wrong.
# Assert "SURVIVED" and a clean exit 0. (The prior rt_gc, scanning only the
# current task's stack, fails this — that's the regression this gate guards.)
#
# Shares native_input.la with build.sh — run SEQUENTIALLY, never in parallel.
