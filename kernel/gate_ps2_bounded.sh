# gate_ps2_bounded.sh <driver> <tag> — Freeze Audit II / Q3 red-path.
#
# Proves a PS/2 driver's OWED waits are bounded: the fixed driver DIAGNOSES an
# unanswered ACK and STOPS, while the pre-fix driver dies on the same input.
#
#   <driver>_faulted  = the FIXED driver, 0xF4 removed so no ACK is owed
#   <driver>_ctrl     = the PRE-FIX driver, same fault
#
# ★ WHAT THIS PROVES AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. A bound claims only "this loop
# terminates", so a self-inflicted never-satisfied wait is a fair test of it.
# It is NOT evidence of fault tolerance: a REPAIR would claim the device was
# fixed, which needs a fault both realistic and persistent -- a standard HAL.3d
# failed twice (SELFREPAIR_3d_DESIGN.md).
#
# ★ AND IT MUST CHECK THE DRIVER STOPS, not merely that it printed. mouse.la's
# first cut diagnosed correctly and then read packets from the device it had
# just declared dead, faulting a second time (EXCEPTION 03) -- a bound that
# reports and continues has MOVED the crash, not removed it.

#  the exact skip-to-green shape this Q3 work exists to remove, reproduced in a
#  gate written to remove it. Found by running it with a bogus name rather than
#  by reading it.
#  The distinction: an absent DRIVER SOURCE means the caller named something that
#  is not a driver (a configuration error -> FAIL). An absent build SCRIPT for a
#  real driver means this red-path harness was never built for it (-> SKIP).
