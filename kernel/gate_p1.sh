#  P1 GATE — the kernel process table (LogosInit brick 1 of 7).
#
#  Erik's ruling (2026-09-06): LogosInit supervises FAULT-ISOLATED PROCESSES.
#  P1 is the foundation — a real PCB array the kernel owns, with a scheduler
#  over it, replacing HH2c's hardcoded two-process/one-stage-byte demo.
#
#  ★ WHY THREE PROCESSES, AND NOT TWO. This is the whole design of the gate.
#  HH2c already boots two isolated LA processes and passes its gate — but it
#  does it with a hardcoded `hh2c_stage` byte: the FIRST .sys_exit switches CR3
#  to B, the second halts. That is not a process table, it is an if-statement,
#  and a two-process gate CANNOT TELL THE DIFFERENCE. A third process is the
#  discriminator: nothing hardcoded for two produces a third without a real
#  table and a real scheduler loop. So the gate asserts THREE distinct pids,
#  and that assertion is the entire reason the number is three.
#
#  ASSERTIONS (serial + isa-debug-exit):
#    1. three lines, `P1 pid=N val=X`, one per process, in scheduler order
#    2. the pids are 1, 2, 3 — DISTINCT, so a table exists and carries identity
#    3. each pid reads its OWN value at the SAME virtual address:
#         pid=1 val=A1   pid=2 val=B2   pid=3 val=C3
#       Same VA, three different values = three address spaces, selected by the
#       CR3 the PCB holds. This is HH2's isolation proof, now DRIVEN FROM THE
#       TABLE rather than from a hand-written CR3 round-trip in boot.
#    4. exit 33.
#
#  ★ THE RED CONTROL, which must exist or assertion 3 is vacuous:
#    build with -D P1_SHARED, which points all three PCBs at ONE PML4. Then all
#    three processes read the SAME value at that VA (whoever wrote last), the
#    val assertions fail, and the gate goes red. Without this, "each read its
#    own value" is unfalsifiable — nothing would ever have made it otherwise.
#    Run it with:  ./kernel/gate_p1.sh --red
#    The gate REQUIRES that variant to fail; a green there means the isolation
#    assertion is measuring nothing and THIS GATE MUST BE REWRITTEN.
#
#  Skips (rc 0) if QEMU is absent — and a SKIP IS NOT A PASS.
